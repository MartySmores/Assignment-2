"726","<p>I've always preferred to use long integers as primary keys in databases, for simplicity and (assumed) speed. But when using a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer"">REST</a> or Rails-like URL scheme for object instances, I'd then end up with URLs like this:</p>

<pre><code>http://example.com/user/783<br></code></pre>

<p>And then the assumption is that there are also users with IDs of 782, 781, ..., 2, and 1. Assuming that the web app in question is secure enough to prevent people entering other numbers to view other users without authorization, a simple sequentially-assigned surrogate key also ""leaks"" the total number of instances (older than this one), in this case users, which might be privileged information. (For instance, I am user #726 in stackoverflow.)</p>

<p>Would a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuid"">UUID</a>/GUID be a better solution? Then I could set up URLs like this:</p>

<pre><code>http://example.com/user/035a46e0-6550-11dd-ad8b-0800200c9a66<br></code></pre>

<p>Not exactly succinct, but there's less implied information about users on display. Sure, it smacks of ""security through obscurity"" which is no substitute for proper security, but it seems at least a little more secure.</p>

<p>Is that benefit worth the cost and complexity of implementing UUIDs for web-addressable object instances? I think that I'd still want to use integer columns as database PKs just to speed up joins.</p>

<p>There's also the question of in-database representation of UUIDs. I know MySQL stores them as 36-character strings. Postgres seems to have a more efficient internal representation (128 bits?) but I haven't tried it myself. Anyone have any experience with this?</p>

<hr>

<p>Update: for those who asked about just using the user name in the URL (e.g., http://example.com/user/yukondude), that works fine for object instances with names that are unique, but what about the zillions of web app objects that can really only be identified by number?

"1290","<p>I'm building a listing/grid control in a <code>Flex</code> application and using it in a <code>.NET</code> web application.  To make a really long story short I am getting XML from a webservice of serialized objects.  I have a page limit of how many things can be on a page.  I've taken a data grid and made it page, sort across pages, and handle some basic filtering.  </p>

<p>In regards to paging I'm using a Dictionary keyed on the page and storing the XML for that page.  This way whenever a user comes back to a page that I've saved into this dictionary I can grab the XML from local memory instead of hitting the webservice.  Basically, I'm caching the data retrieved from each call to the webservice for a page of data.</p>

<p>There are several things that can expire my cache.  Filtering and sorting are the main reason.  However, a user may edit a row of data in the grid by opening an editor.  The data they edit could cause the data displayed in the row to be stale.  I could easily go to the webservice and get the whole page of data, but since the page size is set at runtime I could be looking at a large amount of records to retrieve.</p>

<p>So let me now get to the heart of the issue that I am experiencing.  In order to prevent getting the whole page of data back I make a call to the webservice asking for the completely updated record (the editor handles saving its data).</p>

<p>Since I'm using custom objects I need to serialize them on the server to XML (this is handled already for other portions of our software).  All data is handled through XML in e4x.  The cache in the Dictionary is stored as an XMLList.</p>

<p><strong>Now let me show you my code...</strong></p>

<pre><code>var idOfReplacee:String = this._WebService.GetSingleModelXml.lastResult.*[0].*[0].@Id;
var xmlToReplace:XMLList = this._DataPages[this._Options.PageIndex].Data.(@Id == idOfReplacee);

if(xmlToReplace.length() &gt; 0)
{
    delete (this._DataPages[this._Options.PageIndex].Data.(@Id == idOfReplacee)[0]);
    this._DataPages[this._Options.PageIndex].Data += this._WebService.GetSingleModelXml.lastResult.*[0].*[0];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, I get the id of the node I want to replace.  Then I find it in the cache's Data property (<code>XMLList</code>).  I make sure it exists since the filter on the second line returns the <code>XMLList</code>.</p>

<p>The problem I have is with the delete line.  I cannot make that line delete that node from the list.  The line following the delete line works.  I've added the node to the list.</p>

<p>How do I replace or delete that node (meaning the node that I find from the filter statement out of the .Data property of the cache)???</p>

"493","<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>One of the things I've asked a lot about on this site is <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa904594.aspx"">LINQ</a>. The questions I've asked have been wide and varied and often don't have much context behind them. So in an attempt to consolidate the knowledge I've acquired on Linq I'm posting this question with a view to maintaining and updating it with additional information as I continue to learn about LINQ. </p>

<p>I also hope that it will prove to be a useful resource for other people wanting to learn about LINQ. </p>

<h2>What is LINQ?</h2>

<p>From <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa904594.aspx"">MSDN</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The LINQ Project is a codename for a
  set of extensions to the .NET
  Framework that encompass
  language-integrated query, set, and
  transform operations. It extends C#
  and Visual Basic with native language
  syntax for queries and provides class
  libraries to take advantage of these
  capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this means is that LINQ provides a standard way to query a variety of datasources using a common syntax. </p>

<h2>What flavours of LINQ are there?</h2>

<p>Currently there are a few different LINQ providers provided by Microsoft:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397919.aspx"">Linq to Objects</a> which allows you to execute queries on any IEnumerable object.  </li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb425822.aspx"">Linq to SQL</a> which allows you to execute queries against a database in an object oriented manner.  </li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb387098.aspx"">Linq to XML</a> which allows you to query, load, validate, serialize and manipulate XML documents.</li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386964.aspx"">Linq to Entities</a> as suggested by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16322/all-about-linq#33588"">Andrei</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb399399.aspx"">Linq to Dataset</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are quite a few others, many of which are listed <a href=""http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/vardi/archive/2008/10/09/the-linq-list-projects.aspx"">here</a>.</p>

<h2>What are the benefits?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Standardized way to query multiple datasources</li>
<li>Compile time safety of queries</li>
<li>Optimized way to perform set based operations on in memory objects</li>
<li>Ability to debug queries</li>
</ul>

<h2>So what can I do with LINQ?</h2>

<h2>What do I need to use LINQ?</h2>

<p>Linq is currently available in VB.Net 9.0 and C# 3.0 so you'll need Visual Studio 2008 or greater to get the full benefits. (You could always write your code in notepad and compile using MSBuild)</p>

<p>There is also a tool called <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7652/querying-like-linq-when-you-dont-have-linq#7710"">LinqBridge</a> which will allow you to run Linq like queries in C# 2.0. </p>

"1630","<p>Is it possible to compile and run OpenGL programs from under Cygwin? If yes, how?</p>
"
"1219","<p>Ok, I realize I might be downvoted into oblivion for this question, especially given my stance on the matter, but I really need to see some honest, thoughtful debate on the merits of the currently accepted <strong><em>enterprise application</em></strong> design paradigm.</p>

<p>I am not convinced that entity objects should exist.</p>

<p>By entity objects I mean the typical things we tend to build for our applications, like ""Person"", ""Account"", ""Order"", etc.</p>

<p>My current design philosophy is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>All database access must be accomplished via stored procedures.</li>
<li>Whenever you need data, call a stored procedure and iterate over a SqlDataReader or the rows in a DataTable</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note: I have also built enterprise applications with Java EE, java folks please substitute the equvalent for my .NET examples)</p>

<p>I am not anti-OO.  I write lots of classes for different purposes, just not entities.  I will admit that a large portion of the classes I write are static helper classes.</p>

<p>I am not building toys.  I'm talking about large, high volume transactional applications deployed across multiple machines.  Web applications, windows services, web services, b2b interaction, you name it.</p>

<p>I have used OR Mappers.  I have written a few.  I have used the Java EE stack, CSLA, and a few other equivalents.  I have not only used them but actively developed and maintained these applications in production environments.</p>

<p>I have come to the battle-tested conclusion that entity objects are getting in our way, and our lives would be <em>so</em> much easier without them.</p>

<p>Consider this simple example: you get a support call about a certain page in your application that is not working correctly, maybe one of the fields is not being persisted like it should be.  With my model, the developer assigned to find the problem opens <em>exactly 3 files</em>.  An ASPX, an ASPX.CS and a SQL file with the stored procedure.  The problem, which might be a missing parameter to the stored procedure call, takes minutes to solve.  But with any entity model, you will invariably fire up the debugger, start stepping through code, and you may end up with 15-20 files open in Visual Studio.  By the time you step down to the bottom of the stack, you forgot where you started.  We can only keep so many things in our heads at one time.  Software is incredibly complex without adding any unnecessary layers.</p>

<p>Development complexity and troubleshooting are just one side of my gripe.</p>

<p>Now let's talk about scalability.</p>

<p>Do developers realize that each and every time they write or modify any code that interacts with the database, they need to do a throrough analysis of the exact impact on the database?  And not just the development copy, I mean a mimic of production, so you can see that the additional column you now require for your object just invalidated the current query plan and a report that was running in 1 second will now take 2 minutes, just because you added a single column to the select list?  And it turns out that the index you now require is so big that the DBA is going to have to modify the physical layout of your files?</p>

<p>If you let people get too far away from the physical data store with an abstraction, they will create havoc with an application that needs to scale.</p>

<p>I am not a zealot.  I can be convinced if I am wrong, and maybe I am, since there is such a strong push towards Linq to Sql, ADO.NET EF, Hibernate, Java EE, etc.  Please think through your responses, if I am missing something I really want to know what it is, and why I should change my thinking.</p>

<p><em><strong>[Edit]</em></strong></p>

<p>It looks like this question is suddenly active again, so now that we have the new comment feature I have commented directly on several answers.  Thanks for the replies, I think this is a healthy discussion.</p>

<p>I probably should have been more clear that I am talking about enterprise applications.  I really can't comment on, say, a game that's running on someone's desktop, or a mobile app.</p>

<p>One thing I have to put up here at the top in response to several similar answers: orthogonality and separation of concerns often get cited as reasons to go entity/ORM.  Stored procedures, to me, are the best example of separation of concerns that I can think of.  If you disallow all other access to the database, other than via stored procedures, you could in theory redesign your entire data model and not break any code, so long as you maintained the inputs and outputs of the stored procedures.  They are a perfect example of programming by contract (just so long as you avoid ""select *"" and document the result sets).</p>

<p>Ask someone who's been in the industry for a long time and has worked with long-lived applications: how many application and UI layers have come and gone while a database has lived on?  How hard is it to tune and refactor a database when there are 4 or 5 different persistence layers generating SQL to get at the data?  You can't change anything!  ORMs or any code that generates SQL <strong><em>lock your database in stone</em></strong>.</p>

"1958","<p>I need to call a web service written in .NET from Java.  The web service implements the WS-Security stack (either WSE 2 or WSE 3, it's not clear from the information I have).  </p>

<p>The information that I received from the service provider included WSDL, a policyCache.config file, some sample C# code, and a sample application that can successfully call the service.</p>

<p>This isn't as useful as it sounds because it's not clear how I'm supposed to use this information to write a Java client.  If the web service request isn't signed according to the policy then it is rejected by the service.  I'm trying to use Apache Axis2 and I can't find any instructions on how I'm supposed to use the policyCahce.config file and the WSDL to generate a client.</p>

<p>There are several examples that I have found on the Web but in all cases the authors of the examples had control of both the service and the client and so were able to make tweaks on both sides in order to get it to work.  I'm not in that position.</p>

<p>Has anyone done this successfully?</p>

"380","<p>What are all the possible ways in which we can get memory leaks in .NET?</p>

<p>I know of two:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not properly un-registering <a href=""http://diditwith.net/PermaLink,guid,fcf59145-3973-468a-ae66-aaa8df9161c7.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Event Handlers/Delegates</a>.</li>
<li>Not disposing dynamic child controls in Windows Forms:</li>
</ol>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>// Causes Leaks
Label label = new Label();
this.Controls.Add(label);
this.Controls.Remove(label);

// Correct Code
Label label = new Label();
this.Controls.Add(label);
this.Controls.Remove(label);
label.Dispose();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The idea is to list common pitfalls which are not too obvious (such as the above). Usually the notion is that memory leaks are not a big problem because of the garbage collector. Not like it used to be in C++.</p>

<hr>

<p>Great discussion guys, but let me clarify... by definition, if there is no reference left to an object in .NET, it will be Garbage Collected at some time. So that is not a way to induce memory leaks.</p>

<p>In the managed environment, I would consider it a memory leak if you had an unintended reference to any object that you aren't aware of (hence the two examples in my question).</p>

<p><strong>So, what are the various possible ways in which such a memory leak can happen?</strong></p>
"
"419","<p>I have an ASP.NET webservice with along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>[WebService(Namespace = ""http://internalservice.net/messageprocessing"")]
[WebServiceBinding(ConformsTo = WsiProfiles.BasicProfile1_1)]
[ToolboxItem(false)]
public class ProvisioningService : WebService
{
    [WebMethod]
    public XmlDocument ProcessMessage(XmlDocument message)
    {
        // ... do stuff
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am calling the web service from ASP using something like:</p>

<pre><code>provWSDL = ""http://servername:12011/MessageProcessor.asmx?wsdl""
Set service = CreateObject(""MSSOAP.SoapClient30"")
service.ClientProperty(""ServerHTTPRequest"") = True
Call service.MSSoapInit(provWSDL)

xmlMessage = ""&lt;request&gt;&lt;task&gt;....various xml&lt;/task&gt;&lt;/request&gt;""
result = service.ProcessMessage(xmlMessage)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I am encountering is that when the XML reaches the ProcessMessage method, the web service plumbing has added a default namespace along the way. i.e. if I set a breakpoint inside ProcessMessage(XmlDocument message) I see:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;request xmlns=""http://internalservice.net/messageprocessing""&gt;
  &lt;task&gt;....various xml&lt;/task&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I capture packets on the wire I can see that the XML sent by the SOAP toolkit is slightly different from that sent by the .NET WS client. The SOAP toolkit sends:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope
    xmlns:SOAPSDK1=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema""
    xmlns:SOAPSDK2=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""
    xmlns:SOAPSDK3=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/""
    xmlns:SOAP-ENV=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/""&gt;
    &lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
        &lt;ProcessMessage xmlns=""http://internalservice.net/messageprocessing""&gt;
            &lt;message xmlns:SOAPSDK4=""http://internalservice.net/messageprocessing""&gt;
                &lt;request&gt;
                    &lt;task&gt;...stuff to do&lt;/task&gt;
                &lt;/request&gt;
            &lt;/message&gt;
        &lt;/ProcessMessage&gt;
    &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
&lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Whilst the .NET client sends:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;soap:Envelope
    xmlns:soap=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/""
    xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""
    xmlns:xsd=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema""&gt;
    &lt;soap:Body&gt;
        &lt;ProcessMessage xmlns=""http://internalservice.net/messageprocessing""&gt;
            &lt;message&gt;
                &lt;request xmlns=""""&gt;
                    &lt;task&gt;...stuff to do&lt;/task&gt;
                &lt;/request&gt;
            &lt;/message&gt;
        &lt;/ProcessMessage&gt;
    &lt;/soap:Body&gt;
&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It's been so long since I used the ASP/SOAP toolkit to call into .NET webservices, I can't remember all the clever tricks/SOAP-fu I used to pull to get around stuff like this.</p>

<p>Any ideas? One solution is to knock up a COM callable .NET proxy that takes the XML as a string param and calls the WS on my behalf, but it's an extra layer of complexity/work I hoped not to do.</p>

"233","<p>My asp.net page will render different controls based on which report a user has selected e.g. some reports require 5 drop downs, some two checkboxes and 6 dropdowns).</p>

<p>They can select a report using two methods. With <code>SelectedReport=MyReport</code> in the query string, or by selecting it from a dropdown. And it's a common case for them to come to the page with SelectedReport in the query string, and then change the report selected in the drop down.</p>

<p>My question is, is there anyway of making the dropdown modify the query string when it's selected. So I'd want <code>SelectedReport=MyNewReport</code> in the query string and the page to post back.</p>

<p>At the moment it's just doing a normal postback, which leaves the <code>SelectedReport=MyReport</code> in the query string, even if it's not the currently selected report.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> And I also need to preserve ViewState.</p>

<p>I've tried doing <code>Server.Transfer(Request.Path + ""?SelectedReport="" + SelectedReport, true)</code> in the event handler for the Dropdown, and this works function wise, unfortunately because it's a Server.Transfer (to preserve ViewState) instead of a Response.Redirect the URL lags behind what's shown.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm asking the impossible or going about it completely the wrong way. </p>

<p><strong>@Craig</strong> The QueryString collection is read-only and cannot be modified.<br />
<strong>@Jason</strong> That would be great, except I'd lose the ViewState wouldn't I? (Sorry I added that after seeing your response).</p>

"2470","<p>I am trying to set up dynamic per-item menus (Edit Control Block) in SharePoint 2007.  My goal is to have certain features that are available based on the current user's group membership.</p>

<p>I know that the CustomAction tag that controls the creation of this menu item has a Rights attribute.  The problem that I have with this is that the groups I am using have identical rights in the site (ViewListItems, ManageAlerts, etc).  The groups that we have set up deal more with function, such as Manager, Employee, etc.  We want to be able to assign a custom feature to a group, and have the menu items associated with that feature visible only to members of that group.  Everyone has the same basic site permissions, but will have extra options availble based on their login credentials.</p>

<p>I have seen several articles on modifying the Core.js file to hide items in the context menu, but they are an all-or-nothing approach.  There is an interesting post at <a href=""http://blog.thekid.me.uk/archive/2008/04/29/sharepoint-custom-actions-in-a-list-view-webpart.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.thekid.me.uk/archive/2008/04/29/sharepoint-custom-actions-in-a-list-view-webpart.aspx</a> that shows how to dynamically modify the Actions menu.  It is trivial to modify this example to check the users group and show or hide the menu based on membership.  Unfortunately, this example does not seem to apply to context menu items as evidenced here <a href=""http://forums.msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/sharepointdevelopment/thread/c2259839-24c4-4a7e-83e5-3925cdd17c44/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/sharepointdevelopment/thread/c2259839-24c4-4a7e-83e5-3925cdd17c44/</a>.</p>

"2951","<p>(<strong>Updated a little</strong>)</p>

<p>I'm not very experienced with internationalisation using PHP, it must be said, and a deal of searching didn't really provide the answers I was looking for.</p>

<p>I'm in need of working out a reliable way to convert only 'relevant' text to Unicode to send in an SMS message, using PHP (just temporarily, whilst a service is rewritten using C#) - obviously, messages sent at the moment are sent as plain text.</p>

<p>I could conceivably convert everything to the Unicode charset (as opposed to using the standard GSM charset), but that would mean that <em>all</em> messages would be limited to 70 characters (instead of 160).</p>

<p>So, I guess my real question is: <em>what is the most reliable way to detect the requirement for a message to be Unicode-encoded, so I only have to do it when it's</em> <strong><em>absolutely necessary</em></strong> <em>(e.g. for non-Latin-language characters)?</em></p>

<h2>Added Info:</h2>

<p>Okay, so I've spent the morning working on this, and I'm still no further on than when I started (certainly due to my complete lack of competency when it comes to charset conversion).  So here's the revised scenario:</p>

<p>I have text SMS messages coming from an external source, this external source provides the responses to me in plain text + unicode slash-escaped characters.  E.g. the 'displayed' text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let's test öäü éàè אין תמיכה בעברית</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Returns:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let's test \u00f6\u00e4\u00fc \u00e9\u00e0\u00e8 \u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05db\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I can send on to my SMS provider in plaintext, GSM 03.38 or Unicode.  Obviously, sending the above as plaintext results in a lot of missing characters (they're replaced by spaces by my provider) - I need to adapt relating to what content there is.  What I want to <em>do</em> with this is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If all text is within the <a href=""http://www.dreamfabric.com/sms/default_alphabet.html"">GSM 03.38 codepage</a>, send it as-is.  (All but the Hebrew characters above fit into this category, but need to be converted.)</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise, convert it to Unicode, and send it over multiple messages (as the Unicode limit is 70 chars not 160 for an SMS).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As I said above, I'm stumped on doing this in PHP (C# wasn't much of an issue due to some simple conversion functions built-in), but it's quite probable I'm just missing the obvious, here.  I couldn't find any pre-made conversion classes for 7-bit encoding in PHP, either - and my attempts to convert the string myself and send it on seemed futile.</p>

<p><strong>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</strong></p>

<p>The issue is that if you nest controls then DesignMode only works for the first level.  The second and lower levels DesignMode will always return FALSE.</p>

<p>The standard hack has been to look at the name of the process that is running and if it is ""DevEnv.EXE"" then it must be studio thus DesignMode is really TRUE.</p>

<p>The problem with that is looking for the ProcessName works its way around through the registry and other strange parts with the end result that the user might not have the required rights to see the process name.  In addition this strange route is very slow.  So we have had to pile additional hacks to use a singleton and if an error is thrown when asking for the process name then assume that DesignMode is FALSE.</p>

<p>John - Super, cheers. For reference the int 3 syntax is the one required for Intel Macs and iPhone.</p>

<hr>

<p>Chris - Thanks for your comment but there are many reasons to avoid the standard assert() function for codebases ported to different platforms. If you've gone to the trouble of rolling your own assert it's usually because you have additional functionality (logging, stack unwinding, user-interaction) that you wish to retain.</p>

<p>Your suggestion of attempting to replace the hander via an implementation of '__assert"" or similar is not going to be portable. The standard 'assert' is usually a macro and while it may map to __assert on the Mac it doesn't on other platforms.</p>

<p>This works well for deserialization. I am able to allow the class library to deserialize the .xml as normal and the I can use my own <code>XmlSerializer</code> instances with a <code>XmlNodeReader</code> against the internal <code>XmlNode</code>.</p>

<pre><code>public class Config
{
    [XmlElement]
    public string data;

    [XmlAnyElement]
    public XmlNode element;
}

public class MyConfig
{
    [XmlElement]
    public string data;
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        using (Stream fs = new FileStream(@""c:\temp\xmltest.xml"", FileMode.Open))
        {
            XmlSerializer xser1 = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Config));
            Config config = (Config)xser1.Deserialize(fs);

            if (config.element != null)
            {
                XmlSerializer xser2 = new XmlSerializer(typeof(MyConfig));
                MyConfig myConfig = (MyConfig)xser2.Deserialize(new XmlNodeReader(config.element));
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I need to create a utility which will allow the user to generate a new configuration file that includes both the class library configuration as well my own configuration, so new objects will be created which were not read from the .xml file. The question is how can I serialize the data back into .xml? </p>

<p>I realize that I have to initially call <code>XmlSerializer.Serialize</code> on my data before calling the same method on the class library configuration. However, this requires that my data is represented by an <code>XmlNode</code> after calling <code>Serialize</code>. What is the best way to serialize an object into an <code>XmlNode</code> using the <code>XmlSerializer</code>?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>-kevin</p>

<p>btw-- It looks like an <code>XmlNodeWriter</code> class written by Chris Lovett was available at one time from Microsoft, but the links are now broken. Does anyone know of an alternative location to get this class?</p>

  <h3>Jeff Attwood posted 5 Questions for programmers applying for jobs:</h3>

  <p>In an effort to make life simpler for phone screeners, I've put together
  this list of Five Essential Questions
  that you need to ask during an SDE
  screen. They won't guarantee that your
  candidate will be great, but they will
  help eliminate a huge number of
  candidates who are slipping through
  our process today.</p>

  <p><strong>1) Coding</strong> The candidate has to write
  some simple code, with correct syntax,
  in C, C++, or Java.</p>

  <p><strong>2) OO design</strong> The candidate has to
  define basic OO concepts, and come up
  with classes to model a simple
  problem.</p>

  <p><strong>3) Scripting and regexes</strong> The
  candidate has to describe how to find
  the phone numbers in 50,000 HTML
  pages.</p>

  <p><strong>4) Data structures</strong> The candidate has
  to demonstrate basic knowledge of the
  most common data structures.</p>

  <p><strong>5) Bits and bytes</strong> The candidate has
  to answer simple questions about bits,
  bytes, and binary numbers.</p>

  <p>Please understand: what I'm looking
  for here is a total vacuum in one of
  these areas. It's OK if they struggle
  a little and then figure it out. It's
  OK if they need some minor hints or
  prompting. I don't mind if they're
  rusty or slow. What you're looking for
  is candidates who are utterly
  clueless, or horribly confused, about
  the area in question.</p>

"91","<p>I got a Function that returns a <code>Collection&lt;string&gt;</code>, and that calls itself recursively to eventually return one big <code>Collection&lt;string&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Now, i just wonder what the best approach to merge the lists? <code>Collection.CopyTo()</code> only copies to string[], and using a <code>foreach()</code> loop feels like being inefficient. However, since I also want to filter out duplicates, I feel like i'll end up with a foreach that calls <code>Contains()</code> on the <code>Collection</code>.</p>

<p>I wonder, is there a more efficient way to have a recursive function that returns a list of strings without duplicates? I don't have to use a <code>Collection</code>, it can be pretty much any suitable data type.</p>

<p>Only exclusion, I'm bound to Visual Studio 2005 and .net 3.0, so no LINQ.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To clarify: The Function takes a user out of Active Directory, looks at the Direct Reports of the user, and then recursively looks at the direct reports of every user. So the end result is a List of all users that are in the ""command chain"" of a given user.Since this is executed quite often and at the moment takes 20 Seconds for some users, i'm looking for ways to improve it. Caching the result for 24 Hours is also on my list btw., but I want to see how to improve it before applying caching.</p>

"2186","<p>I'm working on a project where we're using a Java applet for part of the UI (a map, specifically), but building the rest of the UI around the applet in HTML/JavaScript, communicating with the applet through LiveConnect/NPAPI.

"5005","<p>A project I'm working on at the moment involves refactoring a C# Com Object which serves as a database access layer to some Sql 2005 databases.</p>

<p>The author of the existent code has built all the sql queries manually using a string and many if-statements to construct the fairly complex sql statement (~10 joins, >10 sub selects, ~15-25 where conditions and GroupBy's). The base table is always the same one, but the structure of joins, conditions and groupings depend on a set of parameters that are passed into my class/method.</p>

<p>Constructing the sql query like this does work but it obviously isn't a very elegant solution (and rather hard to read/understand and maintain as well)... I could just write a simple ""querybuilder"" myself but I am pretty sure that I am not the first one with this kind of problem, hence my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do <em>you</em> construct your database queries?</li>
<li>Does C# offer an easy way to dynamically build queries?</li>

<p>In other words, let's assume I want to write a Fraction class. The fraction can be represented by two ints or two doubles or whatnot. The important thing is that the basic four arithmetic operations are well defined.

"9236","<p>While refactoring some old code I have stripped out a number of public methods that should actually of been statics as they a) don't operate on any member data or call any other member functions and b) because they might prove useful elsewhere.</p>

<p>This led me to think about the best way to group 'helper' functions together.  The Java/C# way would be to use a class of static functions with a private constructor, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>class Helper
{
private:
  Helper() { }
public:
  static int HelperFunc1();
  static int HelperFunc2();
};

<p>However, being C++ you could also use a namespace:</p>

<pre><code>namespace Helper
{
  int HelperFunc1();
  int HelperFunc2();

<p>Try process the message</p>

<ul>
<li>If this fails, wait 5 minutes for that message and try again.</li>
<li>If that process fails 3 times, move the message to a dead letter queue.</li>

"16845","<p>I'm an experienced VS.NET user and trying to get up and running on Xcode 3.1.1.<br>
Here's what I'm trying to accomplish:</p>

<p>I'd like a static library (""Lib"") to have its own xcodeproj file.  I'd an executable application (""App"") that makes use of Lib to reference Lib's xcodeproj file so that changes to Lib cause App to relink.  Ideally, I'd like to be able to edit Lib's source files inside App's Xcode workspace so I don't have to task around all the time to make changes.</p>

<p>I figured out from the online help that I can simply drag the static lib xcodeproj in to my app's project and it gets the reference.  I see that once my static lib xcodeproj is in my app's project, I can simply drag it to the App's target and it understands that App depends on Lib.  This seems like the right path, but things aren't quite working the way I'd like yet.</p>

<p>Here are my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It seems that simply having App depend on Lib doesn't cause App to link with Lib.  It seems that I have to explicitly drag libLib.a from the Lib folder into App's ""Link Binary With Libraries"" build stage.  In VS.NET, simply specifying the project as a solution dependency adds it to the link line.  I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything.</p></li>
<li><p>When I have App open in Xcode and I drag Lib.xcodeproj into it, I don't get any of Lib's source files there.  I only get libLib.a under the ""Lib.xcodeproj"" folder.  In VS.NET, I can edit Lib's source files right there and rebuild it, etc... but with this approach in Xcode, changes to Lib.cpp don't cause Lib to rebuild when I rebuild App.  Ideally, I'd get all of Lib's source files and targets to show up when I drag Lib.xcodeproj into App.  Is there any way of doing this?</p></li>

<p>However, I have a situation where I have a form that gathers input from the user, saves the data to a DB, and afterwards I want to render (and tweak the values of) a special form that posts to the PayPal website.</p>

<p>If the PayPal form's field values were static, there would be no problem, but since I want to manipulate the form server-side (to tweak the qty, desc, price fields etc) this <em>will</em> be a problem.</p>

<p>I was considering redirecting to a different page after writing to the DB, and I suspect this would work fairly well, but it's a bit of extra effort that may be unneccessary.</p>

<p>It has also been suggested to me that I could programmatically render a different form, depending on where in the cycle I am. That is, use a placeholder, and on Page_Load I would add a DB Form (complete with child controls) initially, and the PayPal form after a Postback.</p>

<p>This scenario has got to be a common one for you guys, so I'm looking for opinions advice and any relevant code samples if you have preferred approach.</p>

"96","<p>I have a bowling web application that allows pretty detailed frame-by-frame information entry.  One thing it allows is tracking which pins were knocked down on each ball.  To display this information, I make it look like a rack of pins:</p>

<pre>o o o o
 o o o
  o o
   o</pre>

<p>Images are used to represent the pins.  So, for the back row, I have 4 img tags, then a br tag.  Works great... mostly.  The problem is in small browsers, such as IEMobile.  In this case, where there are may 10 or 11 columns in a table, and there may be a rack of pins in each column, IE will try to shrink the column size to fit on the screen, and I end up with something like this:</p>

<pre>o o o
  o
o o o
 o o
  o</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>o o
o o
o o
 o
o o
 o</pre>

<p>The structure is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;!-- some whitespace --&gt;
        &lt;div class=""...""&gt;&lt;img .../&gt;&lt;img .../&gt;&lt;img .../&gt;&lt;img .../&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;!-- some whitespace --&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

<p>There is no whitespace inside the inner div.  If you look at <a href=""http://www.bowlsk.com/games/view-series.html?series=13717"" rel=""nofollow"">this page</a> in a regular browser, it should display fine.  If you look at it in IEMobile, it does not.</p>

<p>Any hints or suggestions?  Maybe some sort of &amp;nbsp; that doesn't actually add a space?</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Followup/Summary</h3>

<p>I have received and tried several good suggestions, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dynamically generate the whole image on the server.  Good solution, but doesn't really fit my need (hosted on GAE), and a bit more code than I'd like to write.  These images could also be cached after the first generation.</li>
<li>Use CSS white-space declaration.  Good standards based solution, fails miserably in the IEMobile view.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What I ended up doing</h3>

<p><em><em>hangs head and mumbles something</em></em></p>

<p>Yes, that's right, a transparent gif at the top of the div, sized to the width I need.  End code (simplified) looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table class=""game""&gt;
    &lt;tr class=""analysis leave""&gt;
        &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;div class=""smallpins""&gt;&lt;img class=""spacer"" src=""http://seasrc.th.net/gif/cleardot.gif"" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=""/img/pinsmall.gif""/&gt;&lt;img src=""/img/nopinsmall.gif""/&gt;&lt;img src=""/img/nopinsmall.gif""/&gt;&lt;img src=""/img/nopinsmall.gif""/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=""/img/pinsmall.gif""/&gt;&lt;img src=""/img/pinsmall.gif""/&gt;&lt;img src=""/img/nopinsmall.gif""/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=""/img/nopinsmall.gif""/&gt;&lt;img src=""/img/nopinsmall.gif""/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=""/img/nopinsmall.gif""/&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And CSS:</p>

<pre><code>div.smallpins {
    background: url(/img/lane.gif) repeat;
    text-align: center;
    padding:0;
    white-space: nowrap;
}
div.smallpins img {
    width:1em;
    height:1em;
}
div.smallpins img.spacer {
    width:4.5em;
    height:0px;
}
table.game tr.leave td{
    padding:0;
    margin:0;
}
table.game tr.leave .smallpins {
    min-width:4em;
    white-space: nowrap;
    background: none;

"25","<p>I was recently working on an application that sent and received messages over Ethernet and  Serial.  I was then tasked to <strong>add</strong> the monitoring of DIO discretes.  I throught, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""No reason to interrupt the main
  thread which is involved in message
  processing, I'll just create
  <strong><em>another thread</em></strong> that monitors DIO.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This decision, however, proved to be <strong>poor</strong>.  Sometimes the main thread would be interrupted between a Send and a Receive serial message.  This interruption would disrupt the timing and alas, messages would be lost (forever).  </p>

<p>I found another way to monitor the DIO <em>without using another thread</em> and Ethernet and Serial communication were restored to their correct functionality.</p>

<p>The whole fiasco, however, got me thinking. <strong>Are their any general guidelines about when <em>not</em> to use multiple-threads and/or does anyone have anymore examples of situations when using multiple-threads is not a good idea?</strong></p>

"2327","<p>I've implemented a custom item renderer that I'm using with a combobox on a flex project I'm working on. It displays and icon and some text for each item. The only problem is that when the text is long the width of the menu is not being adjusted properly and the text is being truncated when displayed. I've tried tweaking all of the obvious properties to alleviate this problem but have not had any success. Does anyone know how to make the combobox menu width scale appropriately to whatever data it's rendering?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;

<p>EDIT:
I should clarify on thing: I can set the dropdownWidth property on the combobox to some arbitrarily large value - this will make everything fit, but it will be too wide. Since the data being displayed in this combobox is generic, I want it to automatically size itself to the largest element in the dataprovider (the flex documentation says it will do this, but I have the feeling my custom item renderer is somehow breaking that behavior)</p>

"6309","<p>After reading ""<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20702/whats-youra-good-limit-for-cyclomatic-complexity"">What’s your/a good limit for cyclomatic complexity?</a>"", I realize many of my colleagues were quite annoyed with this new <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance"">QA</a> policy on our project: no more 10 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity"">cyclomatic complexity</a> per function.</p>

<p>Meaning: no more than 10 'if', 'else', 'try', 'catch' and other code workflow branching statement. Right. As I explained in '<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/105007/do-you-test-private-method#105114"">Do you test private method?</a>', such a policy has many good side-effects.</p>

<p>But: At the beginning of our (200 people - 7 years long) project, we were happily logging (and no, we can not easily delegate that to some kind of '<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming"">Aspect-oriented programming</a>' approach for logs).</p>

<pre><code>myLogger.info(""A String"");
myLogger.fine(""A more complicated String"");
...
</code></pre>

<p>And when the first versions of our System went live, we experienced huge memory problem not because of the logging (which was at one point turned off), but because of the <em>log parameters</em> (the strings), which are always calculated, then passed to the 'info()' or 'fine()' functions, only to discover that the level of logging was 'OFF', and that no logging were taking place!</p>

<p>So QA came back and urged our programmers to do conditional logging. Always.</p>

<pre><code>if(myLogger.isLoggable(Level.INFO) { myLogger.info(""A String"");
if(myLogger.isLoggable(Level.FINE) { myLogger.fine(""A more complicated String"");
...
</code></pre>

<p>But now, with that 'can-not-be-moved' 10 cyclomatic complexity level per function limit, they argue that the various logs they put in their function is felt as a burden, because each ""if(isLoggable())"" is counted as +1 cyclomatic complexity!</p>

<p>So if a function has 8 'if', 'else' and so on, in one tightly-coupled not-easily-shareable algorithm, and 3 critical log actions... they breach the limit even though the conditional logs may not be <em>really</em> part of said complexity of that function...</p>

<p>How would you address this situation ?<br>
I have seen a couple of interesting coding evolution (due to that 'conflict') in my project, but I just want to get your thoughts first.</p>

<hr>

<p>Thank you for all the answers.<br>
I must insist that the problem is not 'formatting' related, but 'argument evaluation' related (evaluation that can be very costly to do, just before calling a method which will do nothing)<br>
So when a wrote above ""A String"", I actually meant aFunction(), with aFunction() returning a String, and being a call to a complicated method collecting and computing all kind of log data to be displayed by the logger... or not (hence the issue, and the <em>obligation</em> to use conditional logging, hence the actual issue of artificial increase of 'cyclomatic complexity'...)</p>

<p>I now get the '<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_function"">variadic</a> function' point advanced by some of you (thank you John).<br>
Note: a quick test in java6 shows that my <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/varargs.html"">varargs function</a> does evaluate its arguments before being called, so it can not be applied for function call, but for 'Log retriever object' (or 'function wrapper'), on which the toString() will only be called if needed. Got it.</p>

The software should support running from the command line so that virus scan be included into the build process.

"13441","<p>How to enable inno-db support on installed instance of MySql?</p>

<p>I have installed mysql-5.0.67-win32.
'InnoDB' is 'DISABLED' when executing 'show engines'.

(From doc: A value of DISABLED occurs either because the server was started with an option that disables the engine, or because not all options required to enable it were given.)</p>

<p>In my.ini I commented line with 'skip-innodb'. This didn't help.
All other inno-db related variables remain unchanged.</p>

I have mysql-4.0.17-win installed. I uninstall it and after this installed mysql-5.0.67-win32.
In installation wizard I chose MyISAM support only (as far as I understand I disabled inno-db support in such way. When I tried to reinstall with support of inno-db I had problems of using my previous database 'mysql' with account information).</p>

<p>MySQL documentation says that I should use mysqldump to export data and after this to import exported data in process of upgrade.

"1108","<p>Backstory: I'm using <a href=""http://logging.apache.org/log4net/index.html"">log4net</a> to handle all logging for a project I'm working on.  One particular method can be called under several different circumstances -- some that warrant the log messages to be errors and others that warrant the log messages to be warnings.</p>

<p>So, as an example, how could I turn</p>

<pre><code>Public Sub CheckDifference(ByVal A As Integer, ByVal B As Integer)
  If (B - A) &gt; 5 Then
    log.ErrorFormat(""Difference ({0}) is outside of acceptable range."", (B - A))

<p>If I instead open it in Excel manually and save as 'Excel 1997-2004' format explicitly, then open in python usig xlrd, everything is wonderful. Remember, Office thinks the file is already in 'Excel 1997-2004' format. All files are .xls</p>

"7094","<p>I've been developing a site over the past few weeks using CodeIgniter as the framework. I've been thinking of the best way to accomplish something, which in a lot of other frameworks in other languages is relatively simple: sortable tables. CodeIgniter switches off query strings by default, because your URLs contain method parameters. So a URL might look like: </p>

<pre><code>/controller/method/param1/param2
</code></pre>

<p>You might think that you could just add in <code>sortBy</code> and <code>sortOrder</code> as two additional parameters to the controller method. I don't particularly want to do that, mainly because I want to have a re-usable controller. When you use query string parameters, PHP can easily tell you whether there is a parameter called <code>sortBy</code>. However, when you're using URL based parameters, it will vary with each controller.</p>

<p>I was wondering what my options were. As far as I can see they are something like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pass in my <code>sortBy</code> and <code>sortOrder</code> parameters, just suck it up, and develop some less-than-reusable component for it.</li>
<li>Have an additional controller, which will store the <code>sortBy</code> and <code>sortOrder</code> in the session (although it would have to know where you came from, and send you back to the original page).</li>
<li>Have some kind of AJAX function, which would call the controller above; then reload the page.</li>
<li>Hack CodeIgniter to turn query strings back on. Actually, if this is the only option, any links to how to do this would be appreciated.</li>
</ul>

<p>I just can't quite believe such a simple task would present such a problem! Am I missing something? Does anyone have any recommendations?</p>

<p>Edit for clarification: I love jQuery, and I'm already using it on the site, so TableSorter is a good option. However, I would like to do server-side sorting as there are some pages with potentially large numbers of results, including pagination.</p>

"242644","<p>I'm learning Haskell hope it could let me getting closer to functional programming, before learing it, I mostly use C-sytanx like languages, like C, Java or D Programming Language.</p>

<p>I followed the <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Simple_input_and_output"">tutorial on Wikibook</a>, it goes well so far, I could understand most of them before the chapter ""Simple input and output""</p>

<p>But I do have a little question about the coding style of if/else control block used by the tutorial.</p>

<p>In the wikibook, the code look like the following:</p>

<pre><code>doGuessing num = do
   putStrLn ""Enter your guess:""
   guess &lt;- getLine
   if (read guess) &lt; num
     then do putStrLn ""Too low!""
             doGuessing num
     else if (read guess) &gt; num
            then do putStrLn ""Too high!""
                    doGuessing num
            else do putStrLn ""You Win!""
</code></pre>

<p>It makes me confusing, because this coding style is totally volate ""Good Coding Style"" in C-sytnax like programming language, where we should ident if/else if/else at same column.</p>

<p>I know it just not work in Haskell, because it would cause parse error if I ident ""else"" at same column of ""if"".</p>

<p>But what about the following one? I think it is much more clear then the above one. But since the above is used by Wikibook and Yet Another Haskell Tutorial, which marked ""best tutorial available online"" at offical Haskell website, so I'm not sure whether this coding style is a convention in Haskell programs.</p>

<pre><code>doGuessing num = do
    putStrLn ""Enter your guess:""
    guess &lt;- getLine
    if (read guess) &lt; num then
        do
            putStrLn ""Too low!""
            doGuessing num
        else if (read guess) &gt; num then do
            putStrLn ""Too high!""
            doGuessing num
        else do
            putStrLn ""You Win!""
</code></pre>

<p>So, I'm curious about which coding style is used more often or is there anthoer coding style for this piece of code? I would like to know it too.</p>

"5507","<p>I understand benefits of dependency injection itself. Let's take Spring for instance. I also understand benefits of other Spring featureslike AOP, helpers of different kinds, etc. I'm just wondering, what are the benefits of XML configuration such as:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=""Mary"" class=""foo.bar.Female""&gt;
  &lt;property name=""age"" value=""23""/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
&lt;bean id=""John"" class=""foo.bar.Male""&gt;
  &lt;property name=""girlfriend"" ref=""Mary""/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>compared to plain old java code such as:</p>

<pre><code>Female mary = new Female();
mary.setAge(23);
Male john = new Male();
john.setGirlfriend(mary);
</code></pre>

<p>which is easier debugged, compile time checked and can be understood by anyone who knows only java.
So what is the main purpose of a dependency injection framework? (or a piece of code that shows its benefits.)</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong><br/>
In case of</p>

<pre><code>IService myService;// ...
public void doSomething() {
  myService.fetchData();
}
</code></pre>

<p>How can IoC framework guess which implementation of myService I want to be injected if there is more than one? If there is only one implementation of given interface, and I let IoC container automatically decide to use it, it will be broken after a second implementation appears. And if there is intentionally only one possible implementation of an interface then you do not need to inject it.</p>

<p>It would be really interesting to see small piece of configuration for IoC which shows it's benefits. I've been using Spring for a while and I can not provide such example. And I can show single lines which demonstrate benefits of hibernate, dwr, and other frameworks which I use.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong><br/>
I realize that IoC configuration can be changed without recompiling. Is it really such a good idea? I can understand when someone wants to change DB credentials without recompiling - he may be not developer. In your practice, how often someone else other than developer changes IoC configuration? I think that for developers there is no effort to recompile that particular class instead of changing configuration. And for non-developer you would probably want to make his life easier and provide some simpler configuration file.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 3:</strong><br/></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>External configuration of mapping between interfaces and their concrete implementations </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is so good in making it extenal? You don't make all your code external, while you definitely can - just place it in ClassName.java.txt file, read and compile manually on the fly - wow, you avoided recompiling. Why should compiling be avoided?!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You save coding time because you provide mappings declaratively, not in a procedural code </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that sometimes declarative approach saves time. For example, I declare only once a mapping between a bean property and a DB column and hibernate uses this mapping while loading, saving, building SQL based on HSQL, etc. This is where the declarative approach works. In case of Spring (in my example), declaration had more lines and had the same expressiveness as corresponding code. If there is an example when such declaration is shorter than code - I would like to see it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Inversion of Control principle allows for easy unit testing because you can replace real implementations with fake ones (like replacing SQL database with an in-memory one)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do understand inversion of control benefits (I prefer to call the design pattern discussed here as Dependency Injection, because IoC is more general - there are many kinds of control, and we are inverting only one of them - control of initialization). I was asking why someone ever needs something other than a programming language for it. I definitely can replace real implementations with fake ones using code. And this code will express same thing as configuration - it will just initialize fields with fake values.</p>

<pre><code>mary = new FakeFemale();
</code></pre>

<p>I do understand benefits of DI. I do not understand what benefits are added by external XML configuration compared to configuring code that does the same. I do not think that compiling should be avoided - I compile every day and I'm still alive. I think configuration of DI is bad example of declarative approach. Declaration can be useful if is declared once AND is used many times in different ways - like hibernate cfg, where mapping between bean property and DB column is used for saving, loading, building search queries, etc. Spring DI configuration can be easily translated to configuring code, like in the beginning of this question, can it not? And it is used only for bean initialization, isn't it? Which means a declarative approach does not add anything here, does it?</p>

<p>When I declare hibernate mapping, I just give hibernate some information, and it works based on it - I do not tell it what to do. In case of spring, my declaration tells spring exactly wht to do - so why declare it, why not just do it?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>LAST UPDATE:</strong><br/>
Guys, a lot of answers are telling me about dependency injection, which I KNOW IS GOOD.
The question is about purpose of DI configuration instead of initializing code - I tend to think that initializing code is shorter and clearer.
The only answer I got so far to my question, is that it avoids recompiling, when the configuration changes. I guess I should post another question, because it is a big secret for me, why compiling should be avoided in this case.</p>

"2648","<p>I'm investigating an annotation-based approach to validating Spring beans using <a href=""https://springmodules.dev.java.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">spring modules</a>. In <a href=""http://wheelersoftware.com/articles/spring-bean-validation-framework.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this tutorial</a>, the following bean (getters and setters omitted) is used as an example:</p>

<pre><code>public final class User {

  @NotBlank
  @Length(max = 80)
  private String name;

  @NotBlank
  @Email
  @Length(max = 80)
  private String email;

  @NotBlank
  @Length(max = 4000)
  private String text;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The error message that is used if a particular validation rule is disobeyed should follow this format:</p>

<pre><code>bean-class.bean-propery[validation-rule]=Validation Error message
</code></pre>

<p>Examples for the class shown above include:</p>

<pre><code>User.email[not.blank]=Please enter your e-mail address.
User.email[email]=Please enter a valid e-mail address.
User.email[length]=Please enter no more than {2} characters.
</code></pre>

<p>The fact that the message keys contain the class name presents a couple of problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the class is renamed, the message keys also need to be changed</li>
<li><p>If I have another class (e.g. Person) with an email property that is validated identically to User.email, I need to duplicate the messages, e.g.</p>

<p>Person.email[not.blank]=Please enter your e-mail address.<br>
Person.email[email]=Please enter a valid e-mail address.<br>
Person.email[length]=Please enter no more than {2} characters.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In fact, the documentation claims that is possible to configure a default message for a particular rule (e.g. @Email) like this:</p>

<pre><code>email=email address is invalid
</code></pre>

<p>This default message should be used if a bean-specific message for the rule cannot be found. However, my experience is that this simply does not work. </p>

<p>An alternative mechanism for avoiding duplicate messages is to pass the key of the error message to the rule annotation. For example, assume I have defined the following default error message for the @Email rule</p>

<pre><code>badEmail=Email address is invalid
</code></pre>

<p>This message should be used if I annotate the relevant property like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Email(errorCode=""badEmail"")
private String email;
</code></pre>

<p>However I tried this, out and again, it just doesn't seem to work. Has anyone found a way to avoid duplicating error messages when using this validation framework?</p>

"5504","<p><strong><em>Note</strong>: The code in this question is part of <a href=""http://www.codeplex.com/desleeper"">deSleeper</a> if you want the full source.</em></p>

<p>One of the things I wanted out of commands was a baked design for asynchronous operations.  I wanted the button pressed to disable while the command was executing, and come back when complete.  I wanted the actual work to be performed in a ThreadPool work item.  And lastly, I wanted a way to handle any errors that occurred during the asynchronous processing.</p>

<p>My solution was an AsyncCommand:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class AsyncCommand : ICommand
{
	public event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged;
	public event EventHandler ExecutionStarting;
	public event EventHandler&lt;AsyncCommandCompleteEventArgs&gt; ExecutionComplete;

	public abstract string Text { get; }
	private bool _isExecuting;
	public bool IsExecuting
	{
		get { return _isExecuting; }
		private set
		{
			_isExecuting = value;
			if (CanExecuteChanged != null)
				CanExecuteChanged(this, EventArgs.Empty);
		}
	}

	protected abstract void OnExecute(object parameter);

	public void Execute(object parameter)
	{
		try
		{
			IsExecuting = true;
			if (ExecutionStarting != null)
				ExecutionStarting(this, EventArgs.Empty);

			var dispatcher = Dispatcher.CurrentDispatcher;
			ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(
				obj =&gt;
				{
					try
					{
						OnExecute(parameter);
						if (ExecutionComplete != null)
							dispatcher.Invoke(DispatcherPriority.Normal,
								ExecutionComplete, this,
								new AsyncCommandCompleteEventArgs(null));
					}
					catch (Exception ex)
					{
						if (ExecutionComplete != null)
							dispatcher.Invoke(DispatcherPriority.Normal,
								ExecutionComplete, this,
								new AsyncCommandCompleteEventArgs(ex));
					}
					finally
					{
						dispatcher.Invoke(DispatcherPriority.Normal,
							new Action(() =&gt; IsExecuting = false));
					}
				});
		}
		catch (Exception ex)
		{
			IsExecuting = false;
			if (ExecutionComplete != null)
				ExecutionComplete(this, new AsyncCommandCompleteEventArgs(ex));
		}
	}

	public virtual bool CanExecute(object parameter)
	{
		return !IsExecuting;
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>so the question is: Is all this necessary?  I've noticed built in asynchronous support for data-binding, so why not command execution?  Perhaps it's related to the parameter question, which is my next question.</p>

"25","<p>Let's face it.  The Singleton Pattern is <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11831/singletons-good-design-or-a-crutch#11839"">highly controversial</a> topic with hordes programmers on <em>both</em> sides of the fence.  There are those who feel like the Singleton is nothing more then a glorified global variable, and others who swear by pattern and use it incessantly.  I don't want the <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/google-singleton-detector/wiki/WhySingletonsAreControversial"">Singleton Controversy</a> to lie at the heart of my question, however.  <strong>Everyone can have a tug-of-war and battle it out and see who wins for all I care</strong>.  What I'm trying to say is, I don't believe there is a single correct answer and I'm not intentionally trying inflame partisan bickering. I am simply interested in <em>singleton-alternatives</em> when I ask the question:</p>

<p><strong>Are their any specific alternatives to the GOF Singleton Pattern?</strong></p>

<p>For example, many times when I have used the singleton pattern in the past, I am simply interested in preserving the state/values of one or several variables.  The state/values of variables, however, can be preserved between each instantiation of the class using <strong>static variables</strong> instead of using the singleton pattern.</p>

<p>What other idea's do you have?</p>

"17216","<p>In a nutshell, there's a global stylesheet:</p>

<pre><code>a { font-family: Arial; }

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span style=""font-family: Helvetica;""&gt;&lt;a href=""...""&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

<p>but nothing works. Is there an easy way to do this?</p>

<p>P.S. I'm dynamically (via PHP) assign different fonts to different links, so creating a special class is not an option.</p>

"3134","<p>SQL to find duplicate entries (within a group)</p>

<p>I have a small problem and I'm not sure what would be the best way to fix it, as I only have limited access to the database (Oracle) itself.
In our Table ""EVENT"" we have about 160k entries, each EVENT has a GROUPID and a normal entry has exactly 5 rows with the same GROUPID. Due to a bug we currently get a couple of duplicate entries (duplicate, so 10 rows instead of 5, just a different EVENTID. This may change, so it's just &lt;> 5). We need to filter all the entries of these groups.</p>

<p>Due to limited access to the database we can not use a temporary table, nor can we add an index to the GROUPID column to make it faster.</p>

<p>We can get the GROUPIDs with this query, but we would need a second query to get the needed data</p>

<pre><code>select A.""GROUPID""
from ""EVENT"" A
group by A.""GROUPID""
having count(A.""GROUPID"") &lt;&gt; 5
</code></pre>

<p>One solution would be a subselect:</p>

<pre><code>select *
from ""EVENT"" A
where A.""GROUPID"" IN (
  select B.""GROUPID""
  from ""EVENT"" B
  group by B.""GROUPID""
  having count(B.""GROUPID"") &lt;&gt; 5
)
</code></pre>

<p>Without an index on GROUPID and 160k entries, this takes much too long.
Tried thinking about a join that can handle this, but can't find a good solution so far.</p>

<p>Anybody can find a good solution for this maybe?</p>

<p>Small edit:
We don't have 100% duplicates here, as each entry still has a unique ID and the GROUPID is not unique either (that's why we need to use ""group by"") - or maybe I just miss an easy solution for it :)</p>

<p>Small example about the data (I don't want to delete it, just find it)</p>

<p><code>
EVENTID | GROUPID | TYPEID<br>
123456&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br>
123457&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145<br>
123458&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2612<br>
123459&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41<br>
123460&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;238<br>
<br>
234567&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br>
234568&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145<br>
234569&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2612<br>
234570&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41<br>
234571&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;238<br>
</code><br>
It has some more columns, like timestamp etc, but as you can see already, everything is identical, besides the EVENTID.</p>

<p>We will run it more often for testing, to find the bug and check if it happens again.</p>

"25749","<p>I met a problem when deveoping a photo viewer application.
I use ListBox to Show Images, which is contained in a ObservableCollection.
I bind the ListBox's ItemsSource to the ObservableCollection.</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;DataTemplate DataType=""{x:Type modeldata:ImageInfo}""&gt;
        &lt;Image
            Margin=""6""
            Source=""{Binding Thumbnail}""
            Width=""{Binding ZoomBarWidth.Width, Source={StaticResource zoombarmanager}}""
            Height=""{Binding ZoomBarWidth.Width, Source={StaticResource zoombarmanager}}""/&gt;
  &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;

&lt;Grid DataContext=""{StaticResource imageinfolder}""&gt;
    &lt;ScrollViewer
        VerticalScrollBarVisibility=""Auto""
        HorizontalScrollBarVisibility=""Disabled""&gt;
        &lt;ListBox Name=""PhotosListBox""
            IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem=""True""
            Style=""{StaticResource PhotoListBoxStyle}""
            Margin=""5""
            SelectionMode=""Extended""
            ItemsSource=""{Binding}""
           /&gt;
    &lt;/ScrollViewer&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I also bind the Image'height in ListBox with a slider.(the slider's Value also bind to zoombarmanager.ZoomBarWidth.Width).
But I found if the collection become larger, such as: contains more then 1000 images, If I use the slider to change the size of iamges, it become a bit slow.
My Question is.
1. Why it become Slow? become it tries to zoom every images,or it just because notify(""Width"") is invoked more than 1000 times.
2. Is there any method to solve this kind of problem and make it faster.</p>

<p>The PhotoListBoxStyle is like this:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;Style~~ TargetType=""{x:Type ListBox}"" x:Key=""PhotoListBoxStyle""&gt;
        &lt;Setter Property=""Foreground"" Value=""White"" /&gt;
        &lt;Setter Property=""Template""&gt;
            &lt;Setter.Value&gt;
                &lt;ControlTemplate TargetType=""{x:Type ListBox}"" &gt;
                    &lt;WrapPanel
                        Margin=""5""
                        IsItemsHost=""True""
                        Orientation=""Horizontal""
                        VerticalAlignment=""Top""
                        HorizontalAlignment=""Stretch"" /&gt;

            &lt;/Setter.Value&gt;
        &lt;/Setter&gt;
    &lt;/Style~~&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But If I use the Style above, I have to use ScrollViewer outside ListBox, otherwise I have no idea how to get a smooth scrolling scrollerbar and the wrappanel seems have no default scrollerbar. Anyone help? It is said listbox with scrollviewer has poor performance.</p>

<p>Now in the data-bind i want to mark ""unread"" announcements with a different css class, so that the web-guy can perform whatever styling he wants to differentiate between read and unread announcements:</p>

<pre><code>System.InvalidCastException occurred

<pre><code>WebControl

<pre><code>Control row = (Control)e.Item.FindControl(""announcementRow"");
if (row != null)
   row.CssClass = row.CssClass + "" announcementItemUnread"";

<p>But <code>Control</code> doesn't contain a definition for <code>CssClass</code>:</p>

<pre><code>'System.Web.UI.Control' does not contain a definition for 'CssClass'

"572","<p>Let's look at an example - books. A book can have 1..n authors. An author can have 1..m books. What is a good way to represent all of the authors of a book?</p>

<p>I came up with an idea to create a Books table and an Authors table. The Authors table has a primary AuthorID key the author's name. The Books table has a primary Book ID and metadata about the book (title, publication date, so on). However, there needs to be a way to link the books to authors and authors to books. And this is where the problem is.</p>

<p>Let's say we have three books by Bob. However, on one book, he wrote it as Bob, PhD. Another he wrote as Dr. Bob, and a third he wrote as Dr. Robert. I want to be able to identify the fact that these authors are, in reality, the same person but credited under different names. I also want to distinguish Bob from another Bob who wrote different books.</p>

<p>Now let's also add in another part to an application, a Person table that keeps track of interesting people. And let's say that Bob is an interesting person. I want to not only say that the author of all three books is Bob, but that this interesting Bob is the same Bob as the author Bob.</p>

<p>Is there a keyboard shortcut, either native to Visual Studio or through Code Rush or other third-party plug-in, to wrap the current selection with an HTML tag?

<p>E.g. I work on trunk and when my v1.0 is finished I create a tag called 1.0 and do a checkout of that tag which is then my live site. Now, I keep working on trunk and after a while there is a v2.0. I create a tag called 2.0 and I want my live site to resemble this 2.0 tag.</p>

<p>My question is: Once the task is done, who should define the <strong>test cases</strong> that should be done on this task? </p>

"3712","<p>How would you go about converting a reasonably large (>300K), fairly mature C codebase to C++?</p>

<p>The kind of C I have in mind is split into files roughly corresponding to modules (i.e. less granular than a typical OO class-based decomposition), using internal linkage in lieu private functions and data, and external linkage for public functions and data. Global variables are used extensively for communication between the modules. There is a very extensive integration test suite available, but no unit (i.e. module) level tests.</p>

<p>I have in mind a general strategy:</p>

<ol>
<li>Compile everything in C++'s C subset and get that working.</li>
<li>Convert modules into huge classes, so that all the cross-references are scoped by a class name, but leaving all functions and data as static members, and get that working.</li>
<li>Convert huge classes into instances with appropriate constructors and initialized cross-references; replace static member accesses with indirect accesses as appropriate; and get that working.</li>
<li>Now, approach the project as an ill-factored OO application, and write unit tests where dependencies are tractable, and decompose into separate classes where they are not; the goal here would be to move from one working program to another at each transformation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously, this would be quite a bit of work. Are there any case studies / war stories out there on this kind of translation? Alternative strategies? Other useful advice?</p>

<p>Note 1: the program is a compiler, and probably millions of other programs rely on its behaviour not changing, so wholesale rewriting is pretty much not an option.</p>

<p>Note 2: the source is nearly 20 years old, and has perhaps 30% code churn (lines modified + added / previous total lines) per year. It is heavily maintained and extended, in other words. Thus, one of the goals would be to increase mantainability.</p>

<p>[For the sake of the question, assume that translation into <strong>C++</strong> is mandatory, and that leaving it in C is <strong>not</strong> an option. The point of adding this condition is to weed out the ""leave it in C"" answers.]</p>

"7831","<p>Since Object Initializers are very similar to JSON, and now there are Anonymous Types in .NET. It would be cool to be able to take a string, such as JSON, and create an Anonymous Object that represents the JSON string.</p>

<pre><code>var person = new {
    FirstName = ""Chris"",

<p>It would be awesome if you could pass in a string representation of the Object Initializer code (preferably something like JSON) to create an instance of an Anonymous Type with that data.</p>

<p>I don't know if it's possible, since C# isn't dynamic, and the compiler actually converts the Object Initializer an<a href=""http://www.developer.com/net/csharp/article.php/3589916"">d Anonymous Type into strongly typed code that can run. This is explained in</a> this article.</p>

<p>Maybe functionality to take JSON and create a key/value Dictionary with it would work best.</p>

<p>I know you can serialize/deserializer an object to JSON in .NET, but what I'm look for is a way to create an object that is essentially loosely typed, similarly to how JavaScript works.</p>

<p>Does anyone know the best solution for doing this in .NET?</p>

<p>UPDATE: Too clarify the context of why I'm asking this... I was thinking of how C# could better support JSON at the language level (possibly) and I was trying to think of ways that it could be done today, for conceptual reasons. So, I thought I'd post it here to start a discussion.</p>

"17981","<p>I'm pretty new to regular expressions. I have a requirement to replace spaces in a piece of multi-line text. The replacement rules are these:</p>

<ul>
<li>Replace all spaces at start-of-line with a non-breaking space (<code>&amp;nbsp;</code>).</li>
<li>Replace any instance of repeated spaces (more than one space together) with the same number of non-breaking-spaces.</li>
<li>Single spaces which are not at start-of-line remain untouched.</li>
</ul>

<p>I used the <a href=""http://www.weitz.de/regex-coach/"" rel=""nofollow"">Regex Coach</a> to build the matching pattern:</p>

<pre><code>/( ){2,}|^( )/

 asda234 4545    54
  34545 345  34534

"25719","<p>I have implemented some table-per-type inheritance in my data model (basically have a ""BaseEntity"" type with all the base information for my items and a ""Employer"" type that inherits from the ""BaseEntity"" item).  Everything appears to be set up correctly and when using the Entities (either via ADO.net Data Services or via Linq to Entities) I can see the Employer type and things appear to be fine.  The issue starts when I create a new Employer entity and attempt to save it.</p>

<p>On the context that doesn't appear to be an .AddToEmployer item (only and AddObject or AddToBaseEntity).
If I use AddObject(""Employer"", NewEmployer) I get and error message of:
""The EntitySet name 'DataEntities.Employer' could not be found.""
If I use AddToBaseEntity(NewEmployer) I get an error message of:
""Unable to determine a valid ordering for dependent operations. Dependencies may exist due to foreign key constraints, model requirements orstore generated values.""</p>

<p>Have I missed a step in setting up the inheritance?  Is there some specific way to save objects that are inherited?  What am I doing wrong?  I assume that the basic issue is that I should have an AddToEmployer, what do I need to do to get that exposed.  It seems odd that it is not an option since I can see the Employer type on the client side and can do things such as ""var NewEmployer = new Employer()"" - which seems to suggest that I can see the Employer type fine.</p>

<p>I have an existing website, based on an ASP.NET web application. I am now using ASP.NET MVC for new development, and intend to gradually replace the bulk of the pages with MVC based pages. </p>

<p>I have two issues here:</p>

<p>1) I need to replace the pages gradually, because I cannot convert everything at once.
2) Existing URLs (of physical files) should be preserved if possible.</p>

<p>The way I see it, I have the following options:</p>

<p>1) Create a brand new MVC web application in the root of the web site, and then include existing HTML/ASPX/ASMX/... pages to that. This way, the routes are always relative to the root of the web site.</p>

<p>2) Modify the existing Global.asax, Web.config, Default.aspx (and so on) to switch the MVC handler on for routing, and then publish my MVC application to a subfolder.</p>

<p>What is the easiest way to do that, and am I missing something?</p>

"17803","<p>I'm using C#, .NET 3.5.  I understand how to utilize events, how to declare them in my class, how to hook them from somewhere else, etc.  A contrived example:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyList
{
    private List&lt;string&gt; m_Strings = new List&lt;string&gt;();
    public EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt; ElementAddedEvent;

    public void Add(string value)
    {
        m_Strings.Add(value);
        if (ElementAddedEvent != null)
            ElementAddedEvent(value, EventArgs.Empty);
    }
}

[TestClass]
public class TestMyList
{
    private bool m_Fired = false;

    [TestMethod]
    public void TestEvents()
    {
        MyList tmp = new MyList();
        tmp.ElementAddedEvent += new EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt;(Fired);
        tmp.Add(""test"");
        Assert.IsTrue(m_Fired);
    }

    private void Fired(object sender, EventArgs args)
    {
        m_Fired = true;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, what I do <em>not</em> understand, is when one declares an event handler</p>

<pre><code>public EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt; ElementAddedEvent;
</code></pre>

<p>It's never initialized - so what, exactly, is ElementAddedEvent? What does it point to?  The following won't work, because the EventHandler is never initialized:</p>

<pre><code>[TestClass]
public class TestMyList
{
    private bool m_Fired = false;

    [TestMethod]
    public void TestEvents()
    {
        EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt; somethingHappend;
        somethingHappend += new EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt;(Fired);
        somethingHappend(this, EventArgs.Empty);
        Assert.IsTrue(m_Fired);
    }

    private void Fired(object sender, EventArgs args)
    {
        m_Fired = true;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I notice that there is an EventHandler.CreateDelegate(...), but all the method signatures suggest this is only used for attaching Delegates to an already existing EventHandler through the typical ElementAddedEvent += new EventHandler(MyMethod).</p>

<p>I'm not sure if <em>what</em> I am trying to do will help... but ultimately I'd like to come up with an abstract parent DataContext in LINQ whose children can register which table Types they want ""observed"" so I can have events such as BeforeUpdate and AfterUpdate, but specific to types.

<pre><code>public class BaseDataContext : DataContext
{
    private static Dictionary&lt;Type, Dictionary&lt;ChangeAction, EventHandler&gt;&gt; m_ObservedTypes = new Dictionary&lt;Type, Dictionary&lt;ChangeAction, EventHandler&gt;&gt;();

    public static void Observe(Type type)
    {
        if (m_ObservedTypes.ContainsKey(type) == false)
        {
            m_ObservedTypes.Add(type, new Dictionary&lt;ChangeAction, EventHandler&gt;());

            EventHandler eventHandler = EventHandler.CreateDelegate(typeof(EventHandler), null, null) as EventHandler;
            m_ObservedTypes[type].Add(ChangeAction.Insert, eventHandler);

            eventHandler = EventHandler.CreateDelegate(typeof(EventHandler), null, null) as EventHandler;
            m_ObservedTypes[type].Add(ChangeAction.Update, eventHandler);

            eventHandler = EventHandler.CreateDelegate(typeof(EventHandler), null, null) as EventHandler;
            m_ObservedTypes[type].Add(ChangeAction.Delete, eventHandler);
        }
    }

    public static Dictionary&lt;Type, Dictionary&lt;ChangeAction, EventHandler&gt;&gt; Events
    {
        get { return m_ObservedTypes; }
    }
}


public class MyClass
{
    public MyClass()
    {
        BaseDataContext.Events[typeof(User)][ChangeAction.Update] += new EventHandler(OnUserUpdate);

"1108","<p>OK, so I readily concede that I'm a newbie when it comes to continuous integration.</p>

<p>That being said, I'm trying to set up a CC.NET environment to educate myself, but I'm having trouble finding the information I need to get the automated build portion set up.</p>

<p>As I understand it, in C# the .csproj file produced by VS 2005 and forward <em>is</em> a valid MSBuild file.  To wit, I've been able to integrate the MSBuild task into CC.NET using the .csproj file, but I have a few issues with this:</p>

<ol>
<li>There's a lot going on in here that I'm not sure I really need in an automated build environment.</li>
<li>I didn't create this file.  I do not understand it, and that scares me. (<a href=""http://www.pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/coincidence"">Programming By Coincidence</a>)</li>
<li>Most of what is going on seems to be abstracted through <code>$(MSBuildToolsPath)\Microsoft.CSharp.targets</code></li>
<li>As a result of 1, 2, and 3, modifying the file to include something like MbUnit seems convoluted and more difficult than it needs to be.  My only real option is to include it in the <code>AfterBuild</code> section, which seems kind of like a hack to me.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, a few questions for the CC.NET folks, the MSBuild folks, and the MbUnit folks.</p>

<ol>
<li>When using MSBuild, is it advisable to use the VS-generated .csproj file as the build file?  Or should I create my own?</li>
<li>Should MbUnit tests be part of the MSBuild file or the CC.NET file?  My research seems to suggest that they belong in the MSBuild file.  If that is the case, do I create a new MSBuild .proj file and check that in to CVS in addition to the .csproj file?  Or does the MbUnit task become part of my .csproj file?</li>
<li>Similar to question 2.  If I add the MbUnit tests to the MSBuild file and end up using the .csproj file, is the <code>Target Name=""AfterBuild""</code> really the section to add that information?  Shouldn't there be a <code>Target Name=""Test""</code> section?  Using the VS generated .csproj file seems to prevent the second option.</li>
</ol>

<p>I know there's a lot there, but most of what I've been able to find online assumes a certain level of familiarity with these topics that I just don't have -- unless I'm mistaken, the learning curve for this stuff isn't a curve at all, it's a step function. :)</p>

<p>Edit 1: I updated the text to be a bit more concise and to address some lingering questions I've had with the answers.</p>
"
"20879","<p>I'd like to include some simple video editing functionality for the Python application I'm writing and googling comes up with:</p>

<ol>
<li>pymedia</li>
<li>pyglet (using the media module)</li>
<li>gst-python</li>
</ol>

<p>Requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Small footprint. I'm already using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WxPython"" rel=""nofollow"">wxPython</a> (just because), which bloats up the final EXE file pretty easily so preferably whatever I use to implement this video editing functionality shouldn't add to the bloat significantly.</li>
<li>The library should still be actively maintained.</li>
<li>It shouldn't require proprietary licensing, so FMOD is out of the question.</li>
<li>Minimal dependencies</li>
<li>Not a full-blown video editor. No need for fancy pants stuff. Just the ability to skip to different parts of a video and either grab a frame or put (multiple) markers for start and end of video sections to lop off bits.</li>
<li>Cross platform - should be able to run on Windows, Linux and OS&nbsp;X at the end of the day.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you've used any of the above video editing libraries listed above or others I have yet to come across in your Python application, I'd like to know the pitfalls for each and how they stack up against each other. If you also know of a Python binding for avbin, I would like to know where to find it.</p>

<p>gst-python (Gstreamer with Python bindings) doesn't seem to be very well documented. It also appears to be tightly coupled with pyGTK, which is also a pretty big toolkit.</p>

"11411","<p>How do i take advantage of MySQL's ability to cache prepared statements?
One reason to use prepared statements is that there is no need to send the prepared statement itself multiple times if the same prepared statement is to be used again. </p>

<pre><code>Class.forName(""com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"");
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(""jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/mydb"" +
        ""?cachePrepStmts=true"", ""user"", ""pass"");
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
    PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement(""select * from MYTABLE where id=?"");
    ps.setInt(1, 1);
    ps.execute();
}
conn.close()
</code></pre>

<p>When running the above Java example I see 5 pairs of Prepare and Execute commands in the mysqld log file. Moving the ps assignment outside of the loop results in a single Prepare and 5 Execute commands of course. The connection parameter ""cachePrepStmts=true"" doesn't seem to make any difference here.<br />
When running a similar program using Spring and Hibernate the number of Prepare commands sent (1 or 5) depends on whether the cachePrepStmts connection parameter is enabled. How does Hibernate execute prepared statements to take advantage of the cachePrepStmts setting? Is it possible to mimic this using pure JDBC?<br />
I was running this on MySQL Server 4.1.22 and mysql-connector-java-5.0.4.jar</p>

req.requestHeaders.push(header);

<p>Yet, if I inspect the traffic with WireShark, the <code>my-bespoke-header</code> is not being sent. If I change to <code>URLRequestMethod.POST</code> and append some data to <code>req.data</code>, then the header is sent, but the receiving application requires a GET not a POST. </p>

<p>The documentation mentions a blacklist of headers that will not get sent. <code>my-bespoke-header</code> is not one of these. It's possibly worth mentioning that the originating request is from a different port on the same domain. Nothing is reported in the policyfile log, so it seems unlikely, but is this something that can be remedied by force loading a crossdomain.xml with a <code>allow-http-request-headers-from</code> despite the fact that this is not a crossdomain issue? Or is it simply an undocumented feature of the Flash Player that it can only send custom headers with a POST request?</p>

"27596","<p>Recently, I noticed some people mentioning that <code>std::list::size()</code> has a linear complexity.<br>
According to <a href=""http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/list/size.html"">some</a> <a href=""http://bytes.com/forum/thread60248.html"">sources</a>, this is in fact implementation dependent as the standard doesn't say what the complexity has to be.<br>
The comment <a href=""http://ahlamnote.blogspot.com/2006/11/stl-list-size-method-is-slow.html"">in this blog entry</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Actually, it depends on which STL you
  are using. Microsoft Visual Studio V6
  implements size() as {return (_Size);
  } whereas gcc (at least in versions
  3.3.2 and 4.1.0) do it as { return std::distance(begin(), end()); } The
  first has constant speed, the second
  has o(N) speed</p>

<ol>
<li>So my guess is that for the VC++ crowd <code>size()</code> has constant complexity as Dinkumware
probably won't have changed that fact since VC6. Am I right there?<br></li>

<p>EDIT: Grr, sorry for the noise.  Originally, I had </p>

<pre><code>Action action = () =&gt; if(m_Count &lt; 10) m_Count++; value = m_Count;
</code></pre>

<p>Which threw a compile error, but then right before the post I thought I'd try wrapping it in braces</p>

<pre><code>Action action = () =&gt; { if(m_Count &lt; 10) m_Count++; value = m_Count; }
</code></pre>

<p>Which also threw a compile error, so I jumped to conclusions that it was the same problem.  It works, though, if I toss in a semi-colon after the braces</p>

<pre><code>Action action = () =&gt; { if(m_Count &lt; 10) m_Count++; value = m_Count; };

"16034","<p>I'm interesting in learning about the different layers of abstraction available for making graphical applications.</p>

<p>I see a lot of terms thrown around:  At the highest level of abstraction, I hear about things like C#, .NET, pyglet and pygame.  Further down, I hear about DirectX and OpenGL.  Then there's DirectDraw, SDL, the Win32 API, and still other multi-platform libraries like WxWidgets.</p>

<p>How can I get a good sense of where one of these layers ends and where the next one begins?  What is the ""lowest possible level"" way of creating a window in Windows, in C?  What about C++?  (A code sample would be divine.)  What about in X11?  Are the Windows implementations of OpenGL and DirectX built on top of the Win32 API?  Where can I begin to learn about these things?</p>

<p>There's another question on SO where <a href=""http://www.charlespetzold.com/pw5/"">Programming Windows</a> is suggested.  What about for Linux?  Is there an equivalent such book?</p>

<p>I'm aware that this is very low-level, and that there are many friendlier tools available, but I would like to at least learn the basics of what's going on beneath the surface.  As much as I'd like to begin slinging windows and vectors right off the bat, starting with something like pygame is too high-level for me; I really need to make the full conceptual circuit of <em>how you draw stuff on a computer</em>.</p>

<p>I will certainly appreciate suggestions for books and resources, but I think it would be stupendously cool if the answers to this question filled up with lots of different ways to get to ""Hello world"" with different approaches to graphics programming.  C?  C++?  Using OpenGL?  Using DirectX?  On Windows XP?  On Ubuntu?  Maybe I ask for too much.</p>

"1206","<p>I've been asked by my team leader to investigate MSMQ as an option for the new version of our product. We use SQL Service Broker in our current version. I've done my fair share of experimentation and Googling to find which product is better for my needs, but I thought I'd ask the best site I know for programming answers.</p>

<p>Some details:</p>

<ul>
<li>Our client is .NET 1.1 and 2.0 code; this is where the message will be sent from.</li>
<li>The target in a SQL Server 2005 instance. All messages end up being database updates or inserts.</li>
<li>We will send several updates that must be treated as a transaction.</li>
<li>We have to have perfect message recoverability; no messages can be lost. </li>
<li>We have to be asynchronous and able to accept messages even when the target SQL server is down.</li>
<li>Developing our own queuing solution isn't an option; we're a small team. </li>
</ul>

<p>Things I've discovered so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Both MSMQ and SQL Service Broker can do the job.</li>
<li>It appears that service broker is faster for transactional messages.</li>
<li>Service Broker requires a SQL server running somewhere, whereas MSMQ needs any configured Windows machine running somewhere.</li>
<li>MSMQ appears to be better/faster/easier to set up/run in clusters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Am I missing something? Is there a clear winner here? Any thoughts, experiences, or links would be valued. Thank you!</p>

<p>EDIT: We ended up sticking with service broker because we have a custom DB framework used in some of our client code (we handle transactions better). That code captured SQL for transactions, but not . The client code was also all version 1.1 of .NET, so we'd have to upgrade all the client code. Thanks for your help!</p>

"5441","<p>The question is if a database connection should be passed in by reference or by value?</p>

<p>For me I'm specifically questioning a PHP to MySQL connection, but I think it applies to all databases.</p>

<p>I have heard that in PHP when you pass a variable to a function or object, that it is copied in memory and therefore uses twice as much memory immediately. I have also heard that it's only copied once changes have been made to the value (such as a key being added/removed from an array).</p>

<p>In a database connection, I would think it's being changed within the function as the query could change things like the last insert id or num rows. (I guess this is another question: are things like num rows and insert id stored within the connection or an actual call is made back to the database?)</p>

<p>So, does it matter memory or speed wise if the connection is passed by reference or value? Does it make a difference PHP 4 vs 5?</p>

function DoSomething1(&amp;$connection) { ... }
function DoSomething2($connection) { ... }

"15297","<p>I have an executable that is started by a windows service, this program will be run on a customers machine and will need to connect to a remote share to perform a particular task. This share is specified by the customer via a UI, so we do not know this in advance meaning it can't be ""hard-coded"", or the share mapped in advance.</p>

<p>Previously we required the customer to log on to their machine and run the executable on log-on , but we have always wanted to allow our program to run within a service and not require a log-in, primarily to make it easier for the customer and prevent any accidental log-outs shutting down our software. So this also means we don't know what local user accounts exist on a customers machine, so we have to start the service using the local system account.</p>

<p>We now have, as mentioned above, a wrapper service to start the executable and perform various tasks. This appears to work fine in most cases and accesses the underlying network fine - our software's purpose mainly involves capturing packets etc.</p>

<p>The suggestions I have generally seen to resolve these kind of issues appear to all say use a user account as the system account cannot access network shares, but in our case this isn't possible. Is there any other way we could get this to work?</p>

<p><strong>Edit: I forgot to mention that this application could (and most commonly will be) run on Win2K not XP, and I think I'm right in saying that the Local Network account is not available before XP?</strong></p>

<pre><code>#formulaAlts{

In IE, the element spawns the vertical scrollbar without growing the containing element. To ""solve"" this, a horizontal scrollbar is created.<br />
That sucks. And I don't want it to suck...</p>

"11575","<p>In C++, a function's signature depends partly on whether or not it's const.  This means that a class can have two member functions with identical signatures except that one is const and the other is not.  If you have a class like this, then the compiler will decide which function to call based on the object you call it on: if it's a const instance of the class, the const version of the function will be called; if the object isn't const, the other version will be called.</p>

"13552","<p>I was watching <a href=""http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/TL16/"">Anders' talk about C# 4.0 and sneak preview of C# 5.0</a>, and it got me thinking about when optional parameters are available in C# what is going to be the recommended way to declare methods that do not need all parameters specified?</p>

<p>For example something like the <code>FileStream</code> class has about fifteen different constructors which can be divided into logical 'families' e.g. the ones below from a string, the ones from an <code>IntPtr</code> and the ones from a <code>SafeFileHandle</code>.</p>

<pre><code>FileStream(string,FileMode);
FileStream(string,FileMode,FileAccess);
FileStream(string,FileMode,FileAccess,FileShare);
FileStream(string,FileMode,FileAccess,FileShare,int);
FileStream(string,FileMode,FileAccess,FileShare,int,bool);
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to me that this type of pattern could be simplified by having three constructors instead, and using optional parameters for the ones that can be defaulted, which would make the different families of constructors more distinct [note: I know this change will not be made in the BCL, I'm talking hypothetically for this type of situation].</p>

<p>What do you think? From C# 4.0 will it make more sense to make closely related groups of constructors and methods a single method with optional parameters, or is there a good reason to stick with the traditional many-overload mechanism?</p>

<p>We have used Wininet for years and it's buggy and horrible.  The last straw is the IE8 beta 2 contains a new bug in InternetGetLastResponseInfo().  I can no longer justify using Wininet when our users can install the latest version of IE and break our app.</p>

<p>I have looked at libcurl but it is way too heavy for our needs.  The only thing I need is FTP support. I could spend a day stripping out all the code in libcurl I don't need, but I'd rather just start with a nice simple FTP client library, if possible.</p>

"9506","<p>I'm currently working on a small project with Ocaml; a simple mathematical expression simplifier. I'm supposed to find certain patterns inside an expression, and simplify them so the number of parenthesis inside the expression decreases. So far I've been able to implement most rules except two, for which I've decided to create a recursive, pattern-matching ""filter"" function. The two rules I need to implement are:</p>

<p>-Turn all expressions of the form a - (b + c) or similar into a - b - c</p>

<p>-Turn all expressions of the form a / (b * c) or similar into a / b / c</p>

<p>...which I suspect would be fairly simple, and once I've managed to implement one, I can implement the other easily. However, I'm having trouble with the recursive pattern-matching function. My type expression is this:</p>

<pre><code>type expr =
 | Var of string    		(* variable *)
 | Sum of expr * expr   	(* sum  *)
 | Diff of expr * expr  	(* difference *)
 | Prod of expr * expr  	(* product *)
 | Quot of expr * expr  	(* quotient *)
;;
</code></pre>

<p>And what I'm mainly having trouble on, is in the match expression. For example, I'm trying something like this:</p>

<pre><code>let rec filter exp =
    match exp with
    | Var v -&gt; Var v
    | Sum(e1, e2) -&gt; Sum(e1, e2)
    | Prod(e1, e2) -&gt; Prod(e1, e2)
    | Diff(e1, e2) -&gt;
	    match e2 with
	    | Sum(e3, e4) -&gt; filter (diffRule e2)
	    | Diff(e3, e4) -&gt; filter (diffRule e2)
	    | _ -&gt; filter e2
    | Quot(e1, e2) -&gt;                                 ***this line***
	    match e2 with
	    | Quot(e3, e4) -&gt; filter (quotRule e2)
	    | Prod(e3, e4) -&gt; filter (quotRule e2)
	    | _ -&gt; filter e2
;;
</code></pre>

<p>However, it seems that the match expression on the marked line is being recognized as being part of the previous ""inner match"" instead of the ""principal match"", so all ""Quot(...)"" expressions are never recognized. Is it even possible to have match expressions inside other match expressions like this? And what would be the correct way to end the inner match so I can continue matching the other possibilities?</p>

<p>Ignore the logic, since it's pretty much what I came up with first, it's just that I haven't been able to try it since I have to deal with this ""match"" error first, although any recommendation on how to handle the recursiveness or the logic would be welcome.</p>

"33776","<p>I'm working on a project which stores single images and text files in one place, like a time capsule. Now, most every project can be saved as one file, like DOC, PPT, and ODF.  But complete web pages <em>can't</em> -- they're saved as a separate HTML file and data folder. <strong>I want to save a web page in a single archive, and while there are several solutions, there's no ""standard"". Which is the best format for HTML archives?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Microsoft has <b><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHTML"">MHTML</a></b> -- basically a file encoded exactly as a MIME HTML email message. It's already based on an existing standard, and MHTML as its own was proposed as <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2557"">rfc2557</a>. This is a great idea and it's been around forever, except it's been a ""proposed standard"" since 1999. Plus, implementations other than IE's are just cumbersome. IE and Opera support it; Firefox and Safari with a cumbersome extension.</p></li>
<li><p>Mozilla has <b><a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/212"">Mozilla Archive Format</a></b> -- basically a ZIP file with the markup and images, with metadata saved as RDF. It's an awesome idea -- Winamp does this for skins, and ODF and OOXML for their embedded images. I love this, except, 1. Nobody else except Mozilla uses it, 2. The only extension supporting it wasn't updated since Firefox 1.5.</p></li>
<li><p><b><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme"">Data URIs</a></b> are becoming more popular. Instead of referencing an external location a la MHTML or MAF, you encode the file straight into the HTML markup as base64. Depending on your view, it's streamlined since the files are <em>right</em> where the markup is. However, support is still somewhat weak. Firefox, Opera, and Safari support it without gaffes; IE, the <em>market leader</em>, only started supporting it at IE8, and even then with limits. </p></li>
<li><p>Then of course, there's <b>""Save complete webpage""</b> where the HTML markup is saved as <code>""savedpage.html""</code> and the files in a separate <code>""savedpage_files""</code> folder. Afaik, everyone does this. It's well supported. But having to handle two separate elements is not simple and streamlined at <em>all</em>. My project needs to have them in a <em>single archive</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Keeping in mind <strong>browser support</strong> and <strong>ease of editing the page</strong>, <strong>what do you think's the best way to save web pages in a single archive?</strong> What would be best as a ""standard""? Or should I just buckle down and deal with the HTML file and separate folder? For the sake of my project, I <em>could</em> support that, but <em>I'd best avoid it.</em></p>

"30181","<p>Anyone use a language called Interactive Data Language, IDL?  It is popular with scientists.  I think it is a poor language because it is proprietary (every terminal running it has to have an expensive license purchased) and it has minimal support (try searching for IDL, the language, right now on stack) .  I am trying to convince my colleagues to stop using it and learn C/C++/Python/Fortran/Java/Ruby.  Does anybody know about or even care about IDL enough to have opinions on it?  What do you think of it?  Should I tell my colleagues to stop wasting their time on it now?  How can I convince them?</p>

<p>Edit: People are getting the impression that I don't know or use IDL. Also, I said IDL has minimal support which is true in one sense, so I must clarify that the scientific libraries are indeed large.  I use IDL all the time, but this is exactly the problem: I am only using IDL because colleagues use it.  There is a file format IDL uses, the .sav, which can only be opened in IDL.  So I must use IDL to work with this data and transfer the data back to colleagues, but I know I would be more efficient in another language.  This is like someone sending you a microsoft word file in an email attachment and if you don't understand how wrong that is then you probably write too many words not enough code and you bought microsoft word.</p>

<p>Edit:  As an alternative to IDL Python is popular.  Here is a list of <a href=""http://www.astrobetter.com/idl/idl-vs-python/"">The Pros of IDL</a> (and the cons) from <a href=""http://www.astrobetter.com/"">AstroBetter</a>:</p>

"19964","<p>I'm not a great Linux expert, but I'm comfortable running my Ubuntu desktop.  I've also got a little experience running Ubuntu as a server as well, for my home network.</p>

<p>At work, we're considering switching away from our current Solaris based setup to something Linux based.  Our sysadmin is pushing for something like RedHat Enterprise or CentOS.  However, at the same time, he's pushing for the developers (like me!) to take more of a role in running the machine.</p>

<p>I've tried to push back by suggesting that we go with Ubuntu for the server.  The majority of the development team has Ubuntu experience, as opposed to very little with RedHat.  However, the sysadmin tells me that Ubuntu is not really suitable for a production server.</p>

<p>Our scalability needs are not that high, probably low double-digit requests per second max.  For security, we need it to be ""reasonably secure.""  In other words, we're not storing credit cards or medical records, just emails and such.  Essentially, we'll be serving Ruby on Rails and PHP web apps from it.</p>

<p>What exactly disqualifies Ubuntu as a candidate for a production server?</p>

"
"15614","<p>How do you reverse the effect of a merge on polarised branches without dying of agony?</p>

<p>This problem has been plaguing me for <strong>months</strong> and I have finally given up. </p>

<p>You have 1 Repository, with 2  <strong>Named</strong> Branches.  A and B. </p>

<p>Changes that occur to A will inevitably occur on B. </p>

<p>Changes that occur directly on B MUST NEVER occur on A. </p>

<p>In such a configuration, merging ""B"" into ""A"" produces a dire problem in the repository, as all the changes to B appear in A as if they were made in A. </p>

<p>The only ""normal"" way to recover from this situation appears to be ""backing out"" the merge, ie: </p>

<pre><code> hg up -r A
 hg backout -r BadMergeRev --parent BadMergerevBeforeOnA
</code></pre>

<p>Which looks all fine and dandy, until you decide to merge later in the correct direction, and you end up with all sorts of nasty things happening and code that was erased / commented out on specifically branch B suddenly becomes unerased or uncommented. </p>

<p>There has not been a working viable solution to this so far other than ""let it do its thing, and then hand fix all the problems"" and that to be honest is a bit fubar.  </p>

<p>Here is an image clarifying the problem: </p>

<p><em>[Original image lost]</em></p>

<p>Files C &amp; E ( or changes C &amp; E ) must appear only on branch b, and not on branch a.
Revision A9 here ( branch a, revno 9 ) is the start of the problem. </p>

<p>Revisions A10 and A11 are the ""Backout merge"" and ""merge the backout"" phases. </p>

<p>And revision B12 is mercurial, erroneously repeatedly dropping a change that was intended  not to be dropped. </p>

<p>This Dilemma has caused much frustration and blue smoke and I would like to put an end to it. </p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>It may be the obvious answer to try prohibiting the reverse merge from occurring, either with hooks or with policies, I have found the ability to muck this up is rather high and the chance of it happening so likely that even with countermeasures, you <em>must</em> still assume that inevitably, it <em>will</em> happen so that you can solve it when it does.</p>

<h3>To Elaborate</h3>

<p>In the model I have used Seperate files. These make the problem sound simple. These merely represent <em>arbitrary changes</em> which could be a separate line. </p>

<p>Also, to add insult to injury, there have been substantial changes on branch A which leaves the standing problem ""do the changes in branch A conflict with the changes in branch B which just turned up ( and got backed out ) which looks like a change on branch A instead "" </p>

<h3>On History Rewriting Tricks:</h3>

<p>The problem with all these retro-active solutions is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>We have 9000 commits. </li>
<li>Cloning freshly thus takes half an hour</li>
<li>If there exists <em>even one</em> bad clone of the repository <em>somewhere</em>, there is a liklihood of it comming back in contact with the original repository, and banging it up all over again. </li>
<li>Everyone has cloned this repository already, and now several days have passed with on-going commits.</li>
<li>One such clone, happens to be a live site, so ""wiping that one and starting from scratch"" = ""big nono"" </li>
</ol>

<p>( I admit, many of the above are a bit daft, but they are outside of my control ). </p>

<p>The only solutions that are viable are the ones that assume that people <em>can</em> and <em>will</em> do everything wrong, and that there is a way to 'undo' this wrongness. </p>

"17279","<p>I have got two classes, one a subclass of the other (say <code>Animal</code> and <code>Dog</code>). The superclass has got some initializers (say <code>initAnimal</code>), the subclass has some initializers (say <code>initDog</code>). The problem is that it is perfecly legal (from the compiler’s viewpoint) to do something like <code>Dog *adog = [[Dog alloc] initAnimal]</code>, ie. initialize a class using its superclass initializer. I do not like this, because the subclass can have some extra instance variables that I want to make sure are initialized. A look into the header file solves this, but is there a simple way to make the compiler check for me? I have got a feeling I am missing something terribly obvious, but I just can’t put my finger on it :-)</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> The <code>initDog</code> and <code>initAnimal</code> were not the best examples. I meant two really different initializers (like <code>init</code> for <code>Animal</code> and <code>initWithFur</code> for <code>Dog</code>). If I wanted every dog to have some fur assigned, I would have made the fur part of the initializer, so that nobody could obtain a dog object without a fur. But then it’s still easy to mistakenly initialize the instance with the superclass <code>init</code>, and then I’m hosed.</p>

<p>Thanks for bringing up the designated initializers, Jason. It did not occur to me before, but I could overload the designated initializer of the superclass and set some sane defaults there. But I would still prefer if I could somehow make it illegal to use other initializers than those of the class itself – any more ideas?</p>

"35516","<p>I have a large UIScrollView into which I'm placing 3-4 rather large (320x1500 pixels or so) UIImageView image tiles.  I'm adding these UIImageViews to the scroll view inside of my NIB files.  I have one outlet on my controller, and that is to the UIScrollView.  I'm using a property (nonatomic, retain) for this, and sythesizing it.</p>

<p>My question is this:  When I observe this in Memory Monitor, I can see that the memory used goes up quite a bit when the view with all these images is loaded (as expected).  But when I leave the view, it and its controller are dealloc'd, but do not seem to give up anywhere near the memory they had taken up.  When I cut one of these views (there are several in my app) down to just 1-3 images that were 320x460 and left everything else the same, it recaptures the memory just fine.</p>

<p>Is there some issue with using images this large?  Am I doing something wrong in this code (pasted below)?</p>

<p>This is a snippet from the viewController that is causing problems.</p>

<pre><code>- (CGFloat)findHeight
{
    UIImageView *imageView = nil;
    NSArray *subviews = [self.scrollView subviews];

    CGFloat maxYLoc = 0;
    for (imageView in subviews)
    {
            if ([imageView isKindOfClass:[UIImageView class]])
            {
                    CGRect frame = imageView.frame;

                    if ((frame.origin.y + frame.size.height) &gt; maxYLoc) {
                            maxYLoc  = frame.origin.y;
                            maxYLoc += frame.size.height;
                    }
            }
    }
    return maxYLoc;
}

- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    [self.scrollView setContentSize:CGSizeMake(320, [self findHeight])];

    [self.scrollView setCanCancelContentTouches:NO];
    self.scrollView.indicatorStyle = UIScrollViewIndicatorStyleWhite;
    self.scrollView.clipsToBounds = YES;
    self.scrollView.scrollEnabled = YES;

    self.scrollView.pagingEnabled = NO;
}

- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@""DAY Controller Dealloc'd"");
    self.scrollView = nil;
    [super dealloc];
}
</code></pre>

<p>UPDATE:  I've noticed another weird phenomenon.  If I don't use the scroll on the view, it seems to be hanging on to the memory.  But if I scroll around a bunch and ensure that all of the UIImageViews became visible at one point, it will free up and regain most of the memory it lost.</p>

<p>UPDATE2: The reason I'm asking this is my app is actually crashing due to low memory.  I wouldn't mind if it were just caching and using up extra memory, but it doesn't seem to ever release it - even in didReceiveMmoryWarning conditions</p>

"5987","<p>Do you have to pass delete the same pointer that was returned by new, or can you pass it a pointer to one of the classes base types?  For example:</p>

<pre><code>class Base
{
public:
    virtual ~Base();
    ...
};

class IFoo
{
public:
    virtual ~IFoo() {}
    virtual void DoSomething() = 0;
};

class Bar : public Base, public IFoo
{
public:
    virtual ~Bar();
    void DoSomething();
    ...
};

Bar * pBar = new Bar;
IFoo * pFoo = pBar;
delete pFoo;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course this is greatly simplified.  What I really want to do is create a container full of boost::shared_ptr and pass it to some code that will remove it from the container when it is finished. This code will know nothing of the implementation of Bar or Base, and will rely on the implied delete operator in the shared_ptr destructor to do the right thing.</p>

<p>Can this possibly work? My intuition says no, since the pointers will not have the same address.  On the other hand, a dynamic_cast&lt;Bar*> should work, so somewhere the compiler is storing enough information to figure it out.
<hr>
Thanks for the help, everybody who answered and commented. I already knew the importance of virtual destructors, as shown in my example; after seeing the answer I gave it a little thought, and realized the <i>whole reason</i> for a virtual destructor is this exact scenario. Thus it had to work. I was thrown by the absence of a visible means of converting the pointer back to the original. A little more thinking led me to believe there was an invisible means, and I theorized that the destructor was returning the true pointer for delete to release. Investigating the compiled code from Microsoft VC++ confirmed my suspicion when I saw this line in ~Base:</p>

<pre><code>mov	eax, DWORD PTR _this$[ebp]
</code></pre>

<p>Tracing the assembler revealed that this was the pointer being passed to the delete function. Mystery solved.</p>

<p>I've fixed the example to add the virtual destructor to IFoo, it was a simple oversight. Thanks again to everyone who pointed it out.</p>

"1354","<p>In Excel VBA (2003), I've noticed that any <strong>Public</strong> or <strong>Friend</strong>  <strong>Sub</strong> method in either a module or <em>ThisWorkbook</em> that doesn't have any arguments will show up as a Macro that can be run by the user. I.e. when the user goes to Tools --> Macro --> Macros... (or Alt+F8) the method will show up in the list that can be run.</p>

<p>For sanity's sake (organization, maintenance, etc) I do need to separate the code into modules.

"18511","<p>I ran into an interesting behavior recently.  It seems that if I override .equals() to take a parameter other than Object, it doesn't get called.  Can anyone explain to me why this is happening?  It seems to violate my understanding of polymorphism in OOP, but maybe I'm missing something.</p>

<p>Here's much simpler code that shows what I'm seeing:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass {
  private int x;
  public MyClass(int n) { x = n; }
  public boolean equals(Object o) { return false; }
  public boolean equals(MyClass mc) { return x == mc.x; }
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    List&lt;MyClass&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;MyClass&gt;();
    list.add(new MyClass(3));
    System.out.println(""Contains 3? "" + list.contains(new MyClass(3)));
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When this is run, it prints ""<code>Contains 3? false</code>"".  It looks like the equals(Object) function is called, even though there is another that would work.  By contrast, if I write equals like this the code works as expected:</p>

<pre><code>public boolean equals(Object o) {
  if(!(o instanceof MyClass))
    return false;
  MyClass mc = (MyClass)o;
  return x == mc.x;
}

"18484","<p>I am trying to test the likelihood that a particular clustering of data has occurred by chance.  A robust way to do this is Monte Carlo simulation, in which the associations between data and groups are randomly reassigned a large number of times (e.g. 10,000), and a metric of clustering is used to compare the actual data with the simulations to determine a p value.</p>

<p>I've got most of this working, with pointers mapping the grouping to the data elements, so I plan to randomly reassign pointers to data.  THE QUESTION: what is a fast way to sample without replacement, so that every pointer is randomly reassigned in the replicate data sets?</p>

<p>For example (these data are just a simplified example):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Data (n=12 values) - Group A: 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 / Group B: 0.5, 0.6, 0.8 / Group C: 0.4, 0.5 / Group D: 0.2, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For each replicate data set, I would have the same cluster sizes (A=3, B=3, C=2, D=4) and data values, but would reassign the values to the clusters.</p>

<p>To do this, I could generate random numbers in the range 1-12, assign the first element of group A, then generate random numbers in the range 1-11 and assign the second element in group A, and so on.  The pointer reassignment is fast, and I will have pre-allocated all data structures, but the sampling without replacement seems like a problem that might have been solved many times before.</p>

<p>Logic or pseudocode preferred.</p>

<p>It seems to me these are setting configurations server-wide to all applications.  If I allowLinks in the conf/context.xml file, my symbolic links work.  If I don't allowLinks in conf/context.xml, my application's symbolic links do not work, even though I have allowed them in the META-INF/context.xml</p>

<p>My question is, does the conf/context.xml control all applications?  If I want symbolic links to work only in one application, do I need to remove the conf/context.xml and create new context files for each application?  Or is there a way I can allow symbolic links in myapplication only?</p>

"2424","<p>I've seen a number of people claim that you should specifically name each column you want in your select query.</p>

<p>Assuming I'm going to use all of the columns anyway, why would I not use <code>SELECT *</code>?</p>

<p>Even considering the question *<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/128412/sql-query-question-select-from-view-or-select-col1col2from-view"">SQL query - Select * from view or Select col1, col2, … colN from view</a>*, I don't think this is an exact duplicate as I'm approaching the issue from a slightly different perspective.  </p>

<p>One of our principles is to not optimize before it's time.  With that in mind, it seems like using <code>SELECT *</code> should be the <strong>preferred</strong> method until it is proven to be a resource issue or the schema is pretty much set in stone.  Which, as we know, won't occur until development is completely done.</p>

<p>That said, is there an overriding issue to not use <code>SELECT *</code>?</p>

"3268","<p>I am trying to set up a simple transaction for my Linq-to-Sql actions against my Sql 2000 database.  Using TransactionScope it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>using (TransactionScope transaction = new TransactionScope())

    	Store.Product product = GetProduct(""foo"");

    	transaction.Complete();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
    	throw ex;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, i keep getting the following error:</p>

<p><em>The partner transaction manager has disabled its support for remote/network transactions. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8004D025)</em></p>

<p>But, if I set up the transaction using a traditional transaction, it works fine.  So this works fine:</p>

<pre><code>Store.DBDataContext dc = new Store.DBDataContext();
try
{
    dc.Connection.Open();
    dc.Transaction = dc.Connection.BeginTransaction();
    Store.Product product = GetProduct(""foo"");
    dc.InsertOnSubmit(product);
    dc.SubmitChanges();
    dc.Transaction.Commit();
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    dc.Transaction.Rollback();
    throw ex;
}
finally
{
    dc.Connection.Close();
    dc.Transaction = null;
}

<p>I'm wondering if the TransactionScope is doing something different under the covers than my second implementation.  If not, what am I losing by not using TransactionScope?  Also, any guidance on what is causing the error would be good too.  I've confirmed that MSDTC is running in both sql server and on my client machine.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I haven't been able to determine how to do that inline, and not in the code-behind (since it won't necessarily work for what I'm doing).</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>If it helps, since it could very well be possible to do in the code-behind, the LINQ is something to this effect:</p>

"121","<p>In one of my current side projects, I am scanning through some text looking at the frequency of word triplets.  In my first go at it, I used the default dictionary three levels deep.  In other words, topDictionary[word1][word2][word3] returns the number of times these words appear in the text, topdictionary[word1][word2] returns a dictionary with all the words that appeared following words 1 and 2, etc.</p>

<p>This functions correctly, but it is very memory intensive.  In my initial tests it used something like 20 times the memory of just storing the triplets in a text file, which seems like an overly large amount of memory overhead.</p>

<p>My suspicion is that many of these dictionaries are being created with many more slots than are actually being used, so I want to replace the dictionaries with something else that is more memory efficient when used in this manner.  I would strongly prefer a solution that allows key lookups along the lines of the dictionaries.</p>

<p>From what I know of data structures, a balanced binary search tree using something like red-black or AVL would probably be ideal, but I would really prefer not to implement them myself.  If possible, I'd prefer to stick with standard python libraries, but I'm definitely open to other alternatives if they would work best.</p>

<p>So, does anyone have any suggestions for me?</p>

<p>Edited to add:</p>

<p>Thanks for the responses so far.  A few of the answers so far have suggested using tuples, which didn't really do much for me when I condensed the first two words into a tuple.  I am hesitant to use all three as a key since I want it to be easy to look up all third words given the first two.  (ie I want something like the result of topDict[word1,word2].keys() ).  </p>

<p>The current dataset I am playing around with is the most recent version of <a href=""http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/charity-news/wikipedia-for-schools.htm"">Wikipedia For Schools</a>.  The results of parsing the first thousand pages, for example, is something like 11MB for a text file where each line is the three words and the count all tab separated.  Storing the text in the dictionary format I am now using takes around 185MB.  I know that there will be some additional overhead for pointers and whatnot, but the difference seems excessive.</p>

<p>Once again, thank you all for the responses so far.</p>

<p>The only exception to this has been in LINQ to SQL where calling <code>.ToList()</code> would enumerate the <code>IEnumerable</code> prematurely.</p>

"36902","<p>Did the recent purchase of MySQL by Sun and the subsequent buggy releases kill the MySQL brand?</p>

<p>I whole heartedly embraced MySQL when it first came out as I used to be a poor developer and all the RDBMs were too expensive.  I have fond feelings for MySQL and their being able to compete with Oracle and SQL Server.  I credit the original MySQL team for the existence SQL Server Express.  I now use SQL Server Express instead of MySQL for just about everything.  First, I do not like Sun and second, SQL Server Express is significantly more robust and 'Enterprise' than MySQL.</p>

<p>The only significant limitations on SQL Server Express are the 4GB db size and the lack of Agent.  I find that the size limit is not a concern because by the time the db gets close to that size, the application should either be profitable (and you buy the license), or you should kill the product.  The Agent issue is a nice to have, but not critical as you can work around it.</p>

<p>It seems that for db simpletons like me, SQL Server Express is easier to setup and use and is faster and more stable.  And for gurus, they will use PostgresSQL...</p>

<p>Resolved:</p>

<p>So basically, we have a bunch of SQL Server fans (albeit open-minded) on stackoverflow.  It looks like I'm in the right place.  It's sad to see MySQL transform from something you cheer to something you pity.  I hope the founders of the original company try a new endeavor.  I absolutely do not judge them for selling to SUNW - work is naturally profit driven.  I hope we get some people with FU money who don't care about profits who create some products like MySQL used to be.  Othewise, MSFT might take away EXPRESS.</p>

"18623","<p>I'm importing Brazilian stock market data to a SQL Server database. Right now I have a table with price information from three kind of assets: stocks, options and forwards. I'm still in 2006 data and the table has over half million records. I have more 12 years of data to import so the table will exceed a million records for sure.</p>

<p>Now, my first approach for optimization was to keep the data to a minimum size, so I reduced the row size to an average of 60 bytes, with the following columns:</p>

<pre>
[Stock] [int] NOT NULL
[Date] [smalldatetime] NOT NULL
[Open] [smallmoney] NOT NULL
[High] [smallmoney] NOT NULL
[Low] [smallmoney] NOT NULL
[Close] [smallmoney] NOT NULL
[Trades] [int] NOT NULL
[Quantity] [bigint] NOT NULL
[Volume] [money] NOT NULL
</pre>

<p>Now, second approach for optimization was to make a clustered index. Actually the primary index is automatically clusted and I made it a compound index with Stock and Date fields. This is unique, I can't have two quote data for the same stock on the same day. </p>

<p>The clusted index makes sure that quotes from the same stock stay together, and <strong>probably ordered by date</strong>. Is this second information true?</p>

<p>Right now with a half million records it's taking around <strong>200ms</strong> to select <strong>700</strong> quotes from a specific asset. I believe this number will get higher as the table grows.</p>

<p>Now for a third approach I'm thinking in maybe splitting the table in three tables, each for a specific market (stocks, options and forwards). This will probably cut the table size by 1/3. Now, will this approach help or it doesn't matter too much? Right now the table has 50mb of size so it can fit entirely in RAM without much trouble.</p>

<p>Another approach would be using the partition feature of SQL Server. I don't know much about it but I think it's normally used when the tables are large and you can span across multiple disks to reduce I/O latency, am I right? Would partitioning be any helpful in this case? I believe I can partition the newest values (latest years) and oldest values in different tables, The probability of seeking for newest data is higher, and with a small partition it will probably be faster, right?</p>

<p>What would be other good approachs to make this the fastest possible? The mainly select usage of the table will be for seeking a specific range of records from a specific asset, like the latest 3 months of asset X. There will be another usages but this will be the most common, being possible executed by more than 3k users concurrently. </p>

"8912","<p>I'm a pretty experienced Grails developer, but most of my experience has been with using grails for serving up JSON/XML to a flex app and some relatively simple HTML websites.</p>

<p>I've been diving deeper into using the sitemesh integration in grails and I'm struggling a little to find best practices for some more complex configurations, and I'm curious if there are any good tutorials or examples out there.  The <a href=""http://www.opensymphony.com/sitemesh/"">original Sitemesh</a> website isn't that useful as the tags it talks about aren't directly exposed in grails.</p>

<p>A google search is mostly showing old mailing list posts and some vanilla sitemesh stuff which is helping me to move a little further along, but it's a lot of trial and error.</p>

<p>I fully understand how the basic g:layoutTitle, g:layoutHead, and g:layoutBody tags work.  Those are easy and well documented.</p>

<p>The kinds of things that I'd like to see examples for:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>g:applyLayout - <a href=""http://grails.org/doc/1.0.x/ref/Tags/applyLayout.html"">the documentation on this</a> is weak and I don't fully understand the uses suggested in the main docs.  How is this different than setting the <code>meta name='layout' content='foo'</code> property?</p></li>
<li><p>g:pageProperty -  some better examples on how to pull and use properties into the main template by setting the values as meta tags in the page that's being decorated.  The <a href=""http://grails.org/doc/1.0.x/ref/Tags/pageProperty.html"">grails docs on pageProperty</a> show only the onload attribute from the body being brought forward.  I think you can also use meta tag values here as well, anything else?</p></li>
<li><p>can you use multiple levels of sitemesh layouts?  My testing seems to make me think that I can't, but that seems to reduce reusability.  I think that the answer here is some usage of the g:applyLayout, but that's where I'm struggling the most.  </p></li>

</code></pre>

<p>I tried changing script loading order, moving tinyMCE.init() call to the  <code>&lt;script/&gt;</code> tag containing <code>$(document).ready()</code> call—before, after, and inside this call.  No result.  When tinyMCE.init() was called from within <code>$(document).ready()</code> handler, the browser did hang on request—looks like it was too late to call the init function.</p>

<p>Then, after googling a bit about using TinyMCE together with jQuery, I changed <code>tinyMCE.init()</code> call to:</p>

<pre><code>tinyMCE.init({ mode:""none"", theme:""simple"", language:""pl"" });
</code></pre>

<p>and added following jQuery call to the <code>$(document).ready()</code> handler:</p>

<pre><code>$("".mce"").each( function(i) { tinyMCE.execCommand(""mceAddControl"",true,this.id); });
</code></pre>

<p>Still the same error.  But, and here's where things start to look like real voodoo, when I added <code>alert(i);</code> before the <code>tinyMCE.execCommand()</code> call, alerts were given, and TinyMCE textareas were initialized correctly.  I figured this can be a matter of delay introduced by waiting for user dismissing the alert, so I introduced a second of delay by changing the call, still within the <code>$(document).ready()</code> handler, to following:</p>

<pre><code>setTimeout('$("".mce"").each( function(i) { tinyMCE.execCommand(""mceAddControl"",true,this.id); });',1000);
</code></pre>

<p>With the timeout, TinyMCE textareas initialize correctly, but it's duct taping around the real problem.  The problem looks like an evident race condition (especially when I consider that on the same browser, but when server is on localhost, problem doesn't occur).  But isn't JavaScript execution single-threaded?  Could anybody please enlighten me as to what's going on here, where is the actual problem, and what can I do to have it actually fixed?</p>

"32462","<p>Is the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP / Ruby / Python) stack appropriate for Enterprise use? </p>

<p>To be clear, by ""Enterprise"", I mean a large or very large company, where security, robustness, availability of skill sets, Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), scalability, and availability of tools are key considerations. Said another way, a company that looks for external adoption of frameworks / architecture - Something ubiquitous will be seen as more ""valid"" than something exotic / esoteric in this kind of environment.</p>

<p>I've seen use cases where Oracle, IBM, and Sun have implemented systems on the LAMP stack for various Enterprises. I've also seen examples where websites like yellowpages.com (Ruby on rails) and Facebook (php) are built on it. However, none of these examples are exactly what I'm looking for. </p>

<p>I'm really trying to find examples where it is an Enterprise standard at a very large bank (I.e., Citigroup), Telecom company (I.e., AT&amp;T), or manufacturer (I.e., Proctor and Gamble). Just to be clear, I'm not looking for an example where it's used in a limited sense (Like at JPMorgan Chase), but where it's a core platform for systems like CRM, manufacturing systems, or HR management, as well as for internal and external websites. </p>

<p>The perception I've seen so far is that applications built on the LAMP stack perform slower and are less flexible. Some of the arguments I've heard are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Linux is seen as not as well supported as Unix, Solaris, or Windows Servers.</p></li>
<li><p>Apache is harder to configure and maintain than web servers like BEA WebLogic or IIS.  </p></li>
<li><p>MySQL is a ""not ready for prime time"" DB for hobbyists, and not a competitor for SQL Server or Oracle (Although PostgreSQL seems to have a reputation for being more robust). </p></li>
<li><p>PHP / Ruby on rails are optimized for CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete operations). Although this is an advantage when building CRUD-intensive web aplications, both perform slower than Java/Java EE or C# (which are both common Enterprise standards). Furthermore, a lot of applications and systems (like manufacturing systems) have a lot of non-CRUD functionality that may be harder to build with PHP or Ruby, or even Python. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Can anyone please provide arguments to support or refute the idea of the LAMP stack being appropriate for the Enterprise?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

"6403","<p>This is also a question that I asked in a comment in one of Miško Hevery's <a href=""http://misko.hevery.com/2008/11/11/clean-code-talks-dependency-injection/"">google talks</a> that was dealing with dependency injection but it got buried in the comments.</p>

<p>I wonder how can the factory / builder step of wiring the dependencies together can work in C++.</p>

<p>I.e. we have a class A that depends on B. The builder will allocate B in the heap, pass a pointer to B in A's constructor while also allocating in the heap and return a pointer to A.</p>

<p>Who cleans up afterwards? Is it good to let the builder clean up after it's done? It seems to be the correct method since in the talk it says that the builder should setup objects that are expected to have the same lifetime or at least the dependencies have longer lifetime (I also have a question on that). What I mean in code:</p>

<pre><code>class builder {
public:
    builder() :
        m_ClassA(NULL),m_ClassB(NULL) {
    }
    ~builder() {
        if (m_ClassB) {
            delete m_ClassB;
        }
        if (m_ClassA) {
            delete m_ClassA;
        }
    }
    ClassA *build() {
        m_ClassB = new class B;
        m_ClassA = new class A(m_ClassB);
        return m_ClassA;
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now if there is a dependency that is expected to last longer than the lifetime of the object we are injecting it into (say ClassC is that dependency) I understand that we should change the build method to something like:</p>

<pre><code>ClassA *builder::build(ClassC *classC) {
    m_ClassB = new class B;
    m_ClassA = new class A(m_ClassB, classC);
    return m_ClassA;
}

"13422","<p>Before I write my own I will ask all y'all.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a C++ class that is almost exactly like a STL vector but stores data into an array on the stack.  Some kind of STL allocator class would work also, but I am trying to avoid any kind of heap, even static allocated per-thread heaps (although one of those is my second choice).  The stack is just more efficient.</p>

<p>It needs to be almost a drop in replacement for current code that uses a vector.</p>

<p>For what I was about to write myself I was thinking of something like this:</p>

<pre><code>char buffer[4096];
stack_vector&lt;match_item&gt; matches(buffer, sizeof(buffer));
</code></pre>

<p>Or the class could have buffer space allocated internally.  Then it would look like:</p>

<pre><code>stack_vector&lt;match_item, 256&gt; matches;
</code></pre>

<p>I was thinking it would throw std::bad_alloc if it runs out of space, although that should not ever happen.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Using Chromium's stack_container.h works great!  </p>

<p>The reason I hadn't thought of doing it this way myself is that I have always overlooked the allocator object parameter to the STL collection constructors.  I have used the template parameter a few times to do static pools but I'd never seen code or written any that actually used the object parameter.  I learned something new.  Very cool!</p>

<p>The code is a bit messy and for some reason GCC forced me to declare the allocator as an actual item instead of constructing it into vector's allocator parameter.  It went from something like this:</p>

<pre><code>typedef std::pair&lt; const char *, const char * &gt; comp_list_item;
typedef std::vector&lt; comp_list_item &gt; comp_list_type;

comp_list_type match_list;
match_list.reserve(32);
</code></pre>

<p>To this:</p>

<pre><code>static const size_t comp_list_alloc_size = 128;
typedef std::pair&lt; const char *, const char * &gt; comp_list_item;
typedef StackAllocator&lt; comp_list_item, comp_list_alloc_size &gt; comp_list_alloc_type;
typedef std::vector&lt; comp_list_item, comp_list_alloc_type &gt; comp_list_type;

comp_list_alloc_type::Source match_list_buffer;
comp_list_alloc_type match_list_alloc( &amp;match_list_buffer );
comp_list_type match_list( match_list_alloc );
match_list.reserve( comp_list_alloc_size );
</code></pre>

<p>And I have to repeat that whenever I declare a new one.  But it works just like I wanted.</p>

<p>I noticed that stack_container.h has a StackVector defined and I tried using it.  But it doesn't inherit from vector or define the same methods so it wasn't a drop-in replacement.  I didn't want to rewrite all the code using the vector so I gave up on it.</p>

<p>I'm imagining RAM drive software, but with one crucial difference - it would mirror a real folder on my hard drive. More specifically - the folder which contains the project I'm currently working on. This way any builds would be nearly instantaneous (or at least a couple orders of magnitude faster). The RAM drive would synchronize its contents with the hard disk drive in background using only idle resources.</p>

<p>A quick Google search revealed nothing, but perhaps I just don't know how to Google. Perhaps someone knows of such a software? Preferably free, but reasonable fees might be OK too.</p>

<p><b>Added:</b> Some solutions have been suggested which I discarded in the very beginning. They would be (in no particular order):</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Buy a faster hard disk drive (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive"" rel=""nofollow"">SSD</a> maybe or 10K RPM).</b> I don't want a hardware solution. Not only software has the potential to be cheaper (freeware, anyone?), but it can also be used in environments where hardware modifications would be unwelcome if not impossible - say, at the office.</li>
<li><b>Let OS/HDD do the caching - it knows better how to use your free RAM.</b> The OS/HDD have generic cache algorithms that cache everything and try to predict which data will be most needed in the future. They have no idea that for me the priority is my project folder. And as we all know quite well - they don't really cache it much anyway. ;)</li>
<li><b>There are plenty of RAM drives around; use one of those.</b> Sorry, that would be reckless. I need my data to be synchronized back to the HDD whenever there is a bit of free time. In the case of a power failure I could bear losing the last five minutes of work, but not everything since my last checkin.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Added 2:</b> An idea that came up - use a normal RAM drive plus a background folder synchronizer (but I do mean <b>background</b>). Is there any such thing?</p>

<p><b>Added 3:</b> Interesting. I just tried out a simple RAM drive at work. The rebuild time drops from ~14&nbsp;secs to ~7&nbsp;secs (not bad), but incremental build is still at ~5&nbsp;secs - just like on the HDD. Any ideas why? It uses <code>aspnet_compiler</code> and <code>aspnet_merge</code>. Perhaps they do something with other temp files elsewhere?</p>

<p><b>Added 4:</b> Oh, nice new set of answers! :) OK, I've got a bit more info for all you naysayers. :)</p>

<p>One of the main reasons for this idea is not the above-mentioned software (14&nbsp;secs build time), but another one that I didn't have access at the time. This other application has a 100&nbsp;MB code base, and its full build takes about 5 minutes. Ah yes, it's in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarcadero_Delphi"" rel=""nofollow"">Delphi 5</a>, so the compiler isn't too advanced. :) Putting the source on a RAM drive resulted in a BIG difference. I got it below a minute, I think. I haven't measured. So for all those who say that the OS can cache stuff better - I'd beg to differ.</p>

<p>(No this is not homework)</p>

<p>Is there a way to determine if two points are connected on an arbitrary non-directed graph. e.g., the following</p>

<pre><code>Well
  |
  |
  A
  |
  +--B--+--C--+--D--+
  |     |     |     |
  |     |     |     |
  E     F     G     H
  |     |     |     |
  |     |     |     |
  +--J--+--K--+--L--+
                    |
                    |
                    M
                    |
                    |
                  House
</code></pre>

<p>Points A though M (no 'I') are control points (like a valve in a natural gas pipe) that can be either open or closed. The '+'s are nodes (like pipe T's), and I guess the Well and the House are also nodes as well.</p>

<p>I'd like to know if I shut an arbitrary control point (e.g., C) whether the Well and House are still connected (other control points may also be closed). E.g., if B, K and D are closed, we still have a path through A-E-J-F-C-G-L-M, and closing C will disconnect the Well and the House. Of course; if just D was closed, closing only C does not disconnect the House.</p>

<p>Another way of putting this, is C a bridge/cut edge/isthmus?</p>

<p>I could treat each control point as a weight on the graph (either 0 for open or 1 for closed); and then find the shortest path between Well and House (a result >= 1 would indicate that they were disconnected. There's various ways I can short circuit the algorithm for finding the shortest path too (e.g., discard a path once it reaches 1, stop searching once we have ANY path that connects the Well and the House, etc.). And of course, I can also put in some artificial limit on how many hops to check before giving up.</p>

"5314","<p>For fun, I'm trying to write one of my son's favorite board games as a piece of software.  Eventually I expect to build a WPF UI on top of it, but right now I'm building the machine that models the games and its rules.</p>

<p>As I do this, I keep seeing problems that I think are common to many board games, and perhaps others have already solved them better than I will.  </p>

<p>(Note that AI to play the game, and patterns around high performance are not interesting to me.)</p>

<p>So far my patterns are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Several immutable types representing entities in the game box, e.g. dice, checkers, cards, a board, spaces on the board, money, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>An object for each player, which contains the players resources (e.g. money, score), their name, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>An object that represents the state of the game: the players, who's turn it is, the layout of the peices on the board, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>A state machine that manages the turn sequence.  For example, many games have a small pre-game where each player rolls to see who goes first; that's the start state.  When a player's turn starts, first they roll, then they move, then they have to dance in place, then other players guess what breed of chicken they are, then they receive points.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Is there some prior art I can take advantage of?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> One thing I realized recently is that game state can be split in to two categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Game artifact state</strong>. ""I have $10"" or ""my left hand is on blue"".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Game sequence state</strong>.  ""I have rolled doubles twice; the next one puts me in jail"".  A state machine may make sense here.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> What I'm really looking for here is the <em>best</em> way to implement multiplayer turn-based games like Chess or Scrabble or Monopoly.  I'm sure I could create such a game by just working through it start to finish, but, like other Design Patterns, there are probably some ways to make things go much more smoothly that aren't obvious without careful study.  That's what I'm hoping for. </p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Edited:</strong>
Many thanks for all the answers, especially to Robert Gamble who provided a really good answer to the original question and the others who contributed.</p>

<p>In short:</p>

<p><strong><em>To ensure alignment requirements for structure members, the alignment of a structure must be at least as strict as the alignment of its strictest member.</em></strong></p>

<p>As for determining the alignment of structure a few options were presented and with a bit of research this is what I found:</p>

<ul>
<li>c++ std::tr1::alignment_of
<ul>
<li>not standard yet, but close (technical report 1), should be in the C++0x</li>
<li>the following restrictions are present in the latest draft: Precondition:T shall be a complete type, a reference type, or an array of
unknown bound, but shall not be a function type or (possibly
cv-qualified) void.
<ul>
<li>this means that my presented use case with the C99 flexible array won't work (this is not that surprising since flexible arrays are not standard c++) </li>
</ul></li>
<li>in the latest c++ draft it is defined in the terms of a new keyword - alignas (this has the same complete type requirement)</li>
<li>in my opinion, should c++ standard ever support C99 flexible arrays, the requirement could be relaxed (the alignment of the structure with the flexible array should not change based on the number of the array elements)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>c++ boost::alignment_of
<ul>
<li>mostly a tr1 replacement</li>
<li>seems to be specialized for void and returns 0 in that case (this is forbidden in the c++ draft)</li>
<li>Note from developers: strictly speaking you should only rely on the value of ALIGNOF(T) being a multiple of the true alignment of T, although in practice it does compute the correct value in all the cases we know about.</li>
<li>I don't know if this works with flexible arrays, it should (might not work in general, this resolves to compiler intrinsic on my platform so I don't know how it will behave in the general case)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Andrew Top presented a simple template solution for calculating the alignment in the answers
<ul>
<li>this seems to be very close to what boost is doing (boost will additionally return the object size as the alignment if it is smaller than the calculated alignment as far as I can see) so probably the same notice applies</li>
<li>this works with flexible arrays</li>
</ul></li>
<li>use Windbg.exe to find out the alignment of a symbol
<ul>
<li>not compile time, compiler specific, didn't test it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>using offsetof on the anonymous structure containing the type
<ul>
<li>see the answers, not reliable, not portable with c++ non-POD</li>
</ul></li>
<li>compiler intrinsics, eg. MSVC __alignof
<ul>
<li>works with flexible arrays</li>
<li>alignof keyword is in the latest c++ draft</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>If we want to use the ""standard"" solution we're limited to std::tr1::alignment_of, but that won't work if you mix your c++ code with c99's flexible arrays.</p>

<p>As I see it there is only 1 solution - use the old struct hack: </p>

<pre><code>struct S
{
 a_t a;
 b_t b;
 c_t c[1]; // ""has"" more than 1 member, strictly speaking this is undefined behavior in both c and c++ when used this way
};
</code></pre>

<p>The diverging c and c++ standards and their growing differences are unfortunate in this case (and every other case).</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Another interesting question is (if we can't find out the alignment of a structure in a portable way) what is the most strictest alignment requirement possible. There are a couple of solutions I could find:</p>

<ul>
<li>boost (internally) uses a union of variety of types and uses the boost::alignment_of on it</li>
<li>the latest c++ draft contains std::aligned_storage
<ul>
<li>The value of default-alignment shall be the most stringent alignment requirement for any C++ object type whose size is no greater than Len
<ul>
<li>so the <code>std::alignment_of&lt; std::aligned_storage&lt;BigEnoughNumber&gt;&gt;::value</code> should give us the maximum alignment  </li>
<li>draft only, not standard yet (if ever), <code>tr1::aligned_storage</code> does not have this property</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Any thoughts on this would also be appreciated. </p>

"24218","<p>I am currently reading ""Beginning CakePHP:From Novice to Professional"" by David Golding. At one point I have to use the CLI-command ""cake bake"", I get the welcome-screen but when I try to bake e.g. a Controller I get the following error messages:</p>

<p>I suspect that the error-messages has to do with php trying to access the wrong mysql-socket, namely the default osx mysql-socket - instead of the one that MAMP uses. Hence I change my database configurations to connect to the UNIX mysql-socket (:/Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql/mysql.sock):</p>

<p><strong>-- Edit 1 --</strong></p>

<p>Thank you guys for helping me out! :)</p>

<p>I have a problem figuring out where in my.cnf to edit to get MySQL to listen to TCP/IP request. The only paragraph I can find where TCP/IP is mentioned is the following: </p>

<pre><code># Don't listen on a TCP/IP port at all. This can be a security enhancement,
# if all processes that need to connect to mysqld run on the same host.
# All interaction with mysqld must be made via Unix sockets or named pipes.
# Note that using this option without enabling named pipes on Windows
# (via the ""enable-named-pipe"" option) will render mysqld useless!
#
#skip-networking

<p>That allows me to turn off TCP/IP completely, which is the opposite of my intention. I don't know how to go about what you suggest, if you could be more elaborate it would be great. I am a total n00b on these matters :S</p>

"6069","<p>I'm trying to do query result pagination with hibernate and displaytag, and Hibernate <code>DetachedCriteria</code> objects are doing their best to stand in the way. Let me explain...</p>

<p>The easiest way to do pagination with displaytag seems to be implementing the <code>PaginatedList</code> interface that has, among others, the following methods:</p>

<pre><code>/* Gets the total number of results. */
int getFullListSize();

/* Gets the current page of results. */
List getList();

/* Gets the page size. */
int getObjectsPerPage();

/* Gets the current page number. */
int getPageNumber();

/* Get the sorting column and direction */
String getSortCriterion();
SortOrderEnum getSortDirection();
</code></pre>

<p>I'm thinking of throwing my PaginatedList implementation a Criteria object and let it work along theese lines...</p>

<pre><code>getFullListSize() {
    criteria.setProjection(Projections.rowCount());
    return ((Long) criteria.uniqueResult()).intValue();
}

getList() {
    if (getSortDirection() == SortOrderEnum.ASCENDING) {
        criteria.addOrder(Order.asc(getSortCriterion());
    } else if (getSortDirection() == SortOrderEnum.DECENDING) {
        criteria.addOrder(Order.desc(getSortCriterion());
    }
    return criteria.list((getPageNumber() - 1) * getObjectsPerPage(),
                         getObjectsPerPage());
}
</code></pre>

<p>But this doesn't work, because the <code>addOrder()</code> or the <code>setProjection()</code> calls modify the criteria object rendering it in-usable for the successive calls. I'm not entirely sure of the order of the calls, but the db throws an error on <code>getFullListSize()</code> trying to do a ""<code>select count(*) ... order by ...</code>"" which is obviously wrong.</p>

<p>I think I could fix this by creating an object of my own to keep track of query conditions and rebuilding the Criteria object for each call, but that feels like reinventing yet another wheel. Is there a smarter way, possibly copying the Criteria initially passed in and working on that copy?</p>

<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>:
It looks like <code>getList</code> is called first, and <code>getFullListSize</code> is called multiple times after, so, as soon as there's an ordering passed in, <code>getFullListSize</code> will fail. It would make sense to hit the db only once (in <code>getList</code> I'd say) and cache the results, with no need to copy/reset the <code>Criteria</code> object, but still...</p>

<p><strong><em>Update (again)</em></strong>:
Forget about that, once I've done the <code>count</code> I can't do the <code>select</code>, and vice versa. I really need two distinct <code>Criteria</code> objects.</p>

<p>The interface needs to be public because it is the signature the client from outside the dll will use, along with <code>ID</code> and other properties i didn't bother to write in the example to keep it simple.</p>

<p>Andrew, I don't think the solution is create a factory to create another object that will contain the <code>IAM</code> members + Save. I am still thinking... Any other ideas?</p>

"","<p>hey guys, a WCF question for you here:</p>

<p>i have two services and am sending pretty chunky messages between them (~100kb). Though the previously mentioned value is typical of the size of the message, it is possible for it to fluctuate greatly (in both positive and negative directions).</p>

<p>Thus, to deal with such situations where i have to transport a swollen message i have cranked up all the max message size, max string size etc attributes in the app.config on both client and server end (with the relevant endpoint correctly referencing the binding which states the sizes)</p>

<p>The bound i have put in completely exceeds any possible message size for safety's sake. However, where the inter-service communication has proved reliable at the lower end of the message size scale, at the higher end this is not so - messages do not seem to be delivered at all.</p>

<p>the strangest thing is that <em>if</em> the message had exceeded max size then an exception would be thrown (i've encountered enough of these to know this! lol), but nothing gets thrown - it all passes by completely silently. I have experimented with various sizes of messages and it definitely only begins to happen as the message size grows. I can prove are not being received by the destination service as, upon reception, the service makes a log in a DB - but with big messages, no log is made.</p>

<p>as i said, i am almost certain i have increased the size of all applicable attributes in the app.config, and so am completely and utterly baffled by this behaviour!</p>

<p>any suggestions on what could be causing such mystifying behaviour? any help would be <strong>much</strong> appreciated as this is the final hurdle in my project! thanks :-)</p>

"","<p>I have a database which gets updated with 200-1000 new rows per day. Now, I'd like to have an SQL-statement which returns the data day-by-day, hour-by-hour so I can give a rough estimate for the current trend, i.e. how many rows will be added to the database today, just by taking a quick look at those historical graphs.</p>

<p>So, say that I would like to have 10 graphs printed out for the last 10 days, with the data summed up for every hour, like:</p>

<p>Day9:21,24,15,18,...,30,28,25 : tot 348 (number of rows per hour for day 9 and the total)
Day8:32,37,38,43,...,45,55,65 : tot 442 (number of rows per hour for day 8 and the total)
...
...
Day0:18,25,28,X,Y... : tot 'S' (stats for today so far. What will S be?)</p>

<p>How would the SQL-statement look like to collect the data in this day-by-day, hour-for-hour fashion?</p>

<p>Instead of looking at the graps visually in order to give a rough estimate of today's total 'S', even better would be to compute a prediction of 'S'. But that would be a completely other problem I guess... Any tips for how to do that or hints where I can get more information would be much appreciated!</p>

<p>Thanks,

<p>I should probably clarify the motivation behind needing to do this. Perhaps there is a better way ....</p>

<p>We have a baseform from which all other projects are referenced. As an example we pass an object which contains various settings to the project when it is loaded (from the baseform).</p>

<p>If for example, the settings object has some variables change (settings object populated in baseform), we would like the loaded project to listen for this change and obtain a new settings object.</p>

<p>Because the baseform references all the other projects, we need to have the projects ""listen"" for events in the baseform.</p>

"29849","<p>I'm working on a project where I need the following.</p>

<ul>
<li>WCF service on the server side (.NET 3.5)</li>
<li>WPF client for the client side (.NET 3.0)</li>
</ul>

<p>I have an existing application that I have to use the authentication and authorization from (on the server side). I also need to store some metadata about the user in the WCF Service's Thread Principal (a site object). I do this so that I can get at it in the WCF service if I absolutely have to; some business logic may require it. So my plan was to do the following...</p>

<p>Create a custom ServiceAuthorizationManager for the server and in there I will log in the user and get the roles from the existing application. I will cache the ""Site"" object, and upon further reqests pull from the cache. I'll also need a CustomPrincipal object to hold my custom data. I want to impersonate the user so that I can use the builtin roles filtering in WCF like this:</p>

<pre><code>[PrincipalPermission(SecurityAction.Demand, Role = ""Role1"")]
public string[] RolesForUser(string username){}
</code></pre>

<p>I attempted to use the ASP.NET authorization with a custom roles provider, but I wasn't able to set anything on the Current Principal. I also attempted to use a custom IAuthorizationPolicy, but problems arose.  These problems dealt with being able to use the WCFClient.exe application, when it was discovering (using the mex endpoing) it wouldn't give any credentials, so the login would fail. I eventually decided that a ServiceAuthorizationManager was the right way to go, but I'm open to other suggestions.</p>

<p>On the client I will gather the credentials and put them into the WCF proxy class, as follows.</p>

<pre><code>proxy.ChannelFactory.Credentials.UserName.UserName = userName;
proxy.ChannelFactory.Credentials.UserName.Password = password;
</code></pre>

<p>As I started to go down this route, I noticed that I wasn't able to get the username/password in the CheckAccessCore method of my manager class.  Further investigation showed that I should really be authenticating in a custom UserNamePasswordValidator. So I created one of those. The problem is that the validate method never got called.</p>

<p>Further investigation showed that in order for the validate method to be called my WCF service has to have either message or transport level security. The problem with that is that I can't figure out how to have a message or transport level security without an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509"" rel=""nofollow"">X.509</a> certificate.

"15906","<p>I have been working on standardizing the source control structure for our Team Foundation Server rollout for the new year.

<p>I was hoping to get some feedback and answers to a few of the specific questions I have about the proposed structure.  When it comes to structuring source control in TFS, I have learned that there are so many ""standards"" to choose from that there is not really a standard.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The general logic is that a Team Project can contain either a single logical project (where there would be no <code>{Subproject}</code> entry) or multiple related projects in the form of a product or tool suite.  The three major containers are called <code>Development</code>, <code>Integration</code>, and <code>Production</code>.</p>

<p>Within the <code>Development</code> container's Trunk, there are provisions for both the projects which make up the product in the <code>Source</code> folder, with corresponding unit tests available in the <code>Tests</code> folder.  A majority of minor development would occur in the trunk, with branching available through the <code>Trunk</code> folder's sibling <code>Branches</code> folder, which acts as a branching container.  One or more solution files would live within the <code>Trunk</code>, allowing for branches at that level to capture the solution, source, and unit tests.</p>

<p>The <code>Integration</code> container, often called ""main"" in non-TFS implementation, is solely used to integrate Changesets from <code>Development</code> to create a stable and testable build.  It is initially created as a branch from the <code>Development</code> container once a testable product has been attained.  The builds from this container will be used for our testing environment and load testing environment.  We choose to include load testing with testable builds so that we can monitor for changes in performance, being able to rapidly isolate Changesets that may have contributed to any irregularities.</p>

<p><code>Production</code> is used to produce pre-production and production quality builds.  It is initially created as a branch from the <code>Integration</code> container once a stable build has been recommended for release.  Within the <code>Releases</code> folder, a ""branch by release"" structure is followed, providing snapshotting and isolation in a single place.  (For example, when <code>Release 1.1</code> is ready for a pre-production build, the stable <code>Integration</code> container is branched into a new <code>Release 1.1</code> folder in the <code>Production/Releases</code> structure.  Subsequent RCs and RTWs/RTMs are promoted into this folder, as well.)  A branching structure is also present, as seen in the <code>Branches</code> container.  This allows for ""hotfixes"", usually a revision marker (Major.Minor.Revision).  The branch is created from the current release and merged back into the new revision marker - like <code>Release 1.1.1</code>.  The Changeset would be reverse integrated to the <code>Development</code> container's <code>Trunk</code> upon acceptance.</p>

<p>We feel that this structure is a fair balance between robustness and complexity.  But there are a few nagging questions that I can not logically fit into the model.  They are:</p>

<p><strong>Team Build</strong> - The <code>Development</code> and <code>Integration</code> containers will initially start out as being nightly builds, eventually moving to Continuous Integration (CI).  The Production container will be manually built.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><del>Where should the build definitions live?</del> <strong>Edit - Based upon a couple of responses, the TeamBuildTypes folder has been moved to the trunk and branched to the appropriate containers.  This does, however, lead to a new question (follows).</strong></p></li>
<li><p>By having the TeamBuildTypes folder in their appropriate containers, does that mean that all build definitions will be reproduced between the appropriate folders?  For example, having a build definition for development quality builds, as well as testable builds, etc. all living in all TeamBuildType folders throughout the structure.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Documentation Generation</strong> - We use Sandcastle to generate documentation.  Specifically, we also use <a href=""http://www.codeplex.com/SHFB"">Sandcastle Help File Builder</a> to manage the output.  This produces a project file in a format specific to SFHB.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Should generated documentation be stored in the source control structure?</p></li>
<li><p>Should documentation be generated for each container, or does it only posses value for pre-production and production quality builds?</p></li>
<li><p>To preserve fast local build times, should documentation creation be owned by a build definition?</p></li>
<li><p><del>Where should the SHFB-specific files live?  My initial inkling is to put it as a peer to the <code>Source</code> and <code>Tests</code> folders.</del> <strong><em>I agree with the recommondations that it be a peer to <code>Source</code> and <code>Tests</code>.  Diagram changed to reflect this change.</em></strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Third Party Binaries</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Should binaries (controls, libraries, etc.) be stored in source control?</p></li>
<li><p>If so, should it be it's own Team Project?</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>General Documentation</strong> - Non-generated documentation, such as requirements, design documents, test plans, etc. are not going to be reflected by a folder in the source control structure.  After some research and discussion with my developers and peers, using the built-in Documents folder in Team Explorer provides more benefit, since it mirrors the structure within the Team Project Portal and some (business) users do not need the additional complexity of learning the source control aspect of TFS.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>I will update the structure as I get answers to the questions to provide a clearer picture.  I also welcome any other comments related to potential changes.  If I have any other questions, I will make sure to modify this post.</p>

<p>I am reading a video frame by frame and am using background subtraction to '

<p>Assuming the program is kept simple there can be only 2 human. </p>

<p>These objects and move in a manner they can overlapped, make turn and move away at certain interval.</p>

<p>How can i label this humans x 2 correctly. </p>

<p>cvFindContour can return the boundary in a random manner.  for Frame1,Frame2,Frame3....FrameN</p>

<p>I can initially compare rect boundary centroid to label the human correctly. Once the human overlapped and move away this approach will fail.</p>

<p>I tried to keep track of pixel color of the original obj (however the human are fairly similar and certain areas have similar colors like hand,leg,hair ) hence not good enough.</p>

<p>I was considering using Image Statistic like :</p>

<p>CountNonZero(),
SumPixels()
Mean()
Mean_StdDev ()
MinMaxLoc ()
Norm ()</p>

Now that that problem is resolved, I want to step back and ask why there are MX records in the first place.</p>

<p>Specifically: Why does SMTP get special treatment by DNS?</p>

<p>We don't have HX records for HTTP or FX records for FTP.  It seems like every other Internet protocol gets along just fine with DNS' A record.  Indeed, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record"">Wikipedia article on MX records</a> states that the current SMTP spec says that if an MX record does not exist for a receiver, the server should fall back on an A record.  It also mentions some accommodations SMTP made in a pre-DNS world, but that was 25 years ago.  Do we really need MX records any more?</p>

"48181","<p>George Marsaglia has written an excellent random number generator that is extremely fast, simple, and has a much higher period than the Mersenne Twister. Here is the code with a description:</p>

<p><a href=""http://school.anhb.uwa.edu.au/personalpages/kwessen/shared/Marsaglia03.html"">good C random number generator</a></p>

<p>I wanted to port the CMWC4096 code to Java, but it uses several unsigned datatypes so I am not sure how to do this properly. Here is the full C code:</p>

<pre><code>/* choose random initial c&lt;809430660 and */
/* 4096 random 32-bit integers for Q[]   */
static unsigned long Q[4096],c=362436;

unsigned long CMWC4096(void) {
    unsigned long long t, a=18782LL;
    static unsigned long i=4095;
    unsigned long x,r=0xfffffffe;
    i = (i+1) &amp; 4095;
    t = a*Q[i] + c;
    c = (t&gt;&gt;32);
    x = t + c;
    if (x &lt; c) {
        x++;
        c++;
    }
    return (Q[i] = r - x);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone port this to Java? How does this work when you only have signed numbers available?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thanks everybody for the quick answers! For the first 100 million numbers this java code seems to produce the same result as the C code. It is 3 times faster than Java's java.util.Random.</p>

<li>Select the <strong>COM</strong> tab</li>
<li>Select <strong>Microsoft Office 11.0 Object Library</strong></li>

   &lt;WrapperTool&gt;primary&lt;/WrapperTool&gt;
   &lt;Isolated&gt;False&lt;/Isolated&gt;
&lt;/COMReference&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the project is checked into source control and all is well.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Then a developer with <strong>Office 2007</strong> gets the project from source control, and cannot build it because such a reference doesn't exist.</p>

<p>He (i.e. me) checks out the .csproj file, deletes the reference to</p>

<p>and re-adds the COM reference as</p>

<pre><code>Microsoft Office 12.0 Object Library

<pre><code>{00024500-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}
</code></pre>

<p>of which a class is then constructed using a call to COM (language-netural pseudo-code):</p>

<pre><code>public IUnknown CreateOleObject(string className)
{
    IUnknown unk;

    Clsid classID = ProgIDToClassID(className);
    CoCreateInstance(classID, null,

<p>3) If i use the Office 2003 Primary Interop Assemblies, do i have to have office 2003 installed?</p>

<p>4) If i build with the Office 2003 Primary Interop Assemblies, are my customers tied to Office 20003 forever?</p>

<p>5) Are there any <strong><a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=59DAEBAA-BED4-4282-A28C-B864D8BFA513&amp;displaylang=en"">Office 2007</strong> Primary Interop Assemblies</a>?</p>

<p>6) If i install the Office 2007 Primary Interop Assemblies do i have to have Office 2007 installed?</p>

<p>7) What is wrong with using standard COM interop to drive Excel, Word, or Outlook? e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>[ComImport]
[Guid(""00024500-0000-0000-C000-000000000046"")]
public class Excel
{
}

<p>8) What is one achieving when one adds a </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reference</strong> to items on the <strong>COM tab</strong>, </li>
<li>as opposed to using [ComImport], </li>
<li>as opposed to using the <em>Office 2007 Primary Interop Assemblies</em>?</li>
</ul>

<p>9) Is adding a reference using the <strong>COM tab</strong> identical to using <strong>COM interop</strong>, except that it needs a <strong>type library</strong> before you can see it?</p>

<p>10) Are the Office 2003 Primary Interop Assemblies backwards and forwards compatible with:
 - Office 14
 - Office 2007
 - Office 2003
 - Office XP
 - Office 2000
 - Office 97
 - Office 95</p>

<p>If a customer, and a developer, installs a new version of Office, will it still work?</p>

<p>11) Do we have to ship the Office 2003 Primary Interop Assemblies with our application?</p>

<p>12) Does the customer have to install the Office 2003 Primary Interop Assemblies before they can use our application?</p>

<p>13) If a customer installs the Office 2003 Primary Interop Assemblies do they have to have <strong>Office</strong> installed?</p>

<p>14) If a customer installs the Office 2003 Primary Interop Assemblies do they have to have Office <strong>2003</strong> installed?</p>

<p>15) Are the Office 2003 Primary Interop Assembles a free, lite, redistributable version of Office 2003?</p>

<p>16) If my development machine has Office 2007, can i use the Office 2003 PIAs, and ship to a customer with Office XP installed?</p>

"50597","<p>I have a C# (2008/.NET 3.5) class library assembly that supports WPF (based on <a href=""http://dotupdate.wordpress.com/2007/12/05/how-to-add-a-wpf-control-library-template-to-visual-c-express-2008/"">http://dotupdate.wordpress.com/2007/12/05/how-to-add-a-wpf-control-library-template-to-visual-c-express-2008/</a>). I've created several windows, and am now attempting to create a common style set for them. However, as it's a class library (instead of a WPF app), I don't have an app.xaml (and its contained Application &amp; corresponding Application.Resources) in which to store these styles for global access.</p>

<p><strong>So:</strong> How can I create a top-level set of style definitions that'll be seen by all xaml files in the assembly, <em>given that I do not have app.xaml (see above)</em>? And/or is it possible to <em>add</em> a working app.xaml to a class library?</p>

<p>FYI, I did try creating a ResourceDictionary in a ResourceDictionary.xaml file, and include it in each window within a ""Window.Resources"" block. That turned out to solve the styling of Buttons, etc... but not for the enclosing Window. I can put 'Style=""{StaticResource MyWindowStyle}""' in the Window's opening block, and it compiles and shows up in the VS Design window fine, but during actual runtime I get a parse exception (MyWindowStyle could not be found; I'm guessing Visual Studio sees the dictionary included after the line in question, but the CRL does things more sequentially and therefore hasn't loaded the ResourceDictionary yet).</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks for the ideas, but still no go... apparently a class library does NOT support the generic.xaml usage implicitly. I added generic.xaml to my class library project and set its Build Action to ""Resource"". It contains:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ResourceDictionary
    xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation""
    xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml""&gt;
    &lt;Style TargetType=""{x:Type Window}"" x:Key=""MyWindow""&gt;
        &lt;Setter Property=""Background"" Value=""Black""/&gt;
    &lt;/Style&gt;
&lt;/ResourceDictionary&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The window xaml that I want to have use the theme looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Window x:Class=""MyAssembly.ConfigureGenericButtons""

<p>Although the VS Design window doesn't show the window using the MyWindow style (ie black background), it compiles fine and starts up. However, when the app containing this class library makes a call that causes this window to display, I get a XamlParseException:</p>

<pre><code>Cannot find resource named '{MyWindow}'.
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried leaving out the Style parameter, to see if the window would use the style by default (and I tried that both with the x:Key in generic.xaml included and without). No errors, but anything defined in the generic.xaml didn't show up either.</p>

<p>Am I doing something wrong here, or any other ideas on how one might allow for common custom styles to be used on a Window (ie, not have to define the styles in each Window's xaml) -- with the caveat that this is NOT an application?</p>

"37494","<p>In a fairly animated discussion in my team I was made to think what most people like as primary keys. We had the following groups-</p>

<ol>
<li>Int/ BigInt which autoincrement are good enough primary keys.</li>
<li>There should be at least 3 columns that make up the primary key.</li>
<li>Id, GUID and human readable row identifiers all should be treated differently.</li>
</ol>

<p>Whats the best approach for PKs? It would be awesome if you could justify your opinion. Is there a better approach that the above? </p>

<p>EDIT: Anyone has a simple sample/algorithm to generate human readable identifiers for rows that scales well?</p>

"373112","<p>when I try to fine-tune my process, I see that the waiting channel is stext, what does it mean?</p>
"
"5441","<p>Yes, another NULL vs empty string question.</p>

<p>I agree with the idea that NULL means not set, while empty string means ""a value that is empty"". Here's my problem: If the default value for a column is NULL, how do I allow the user to enter that NULL.</p>

<p>Let's say a new user is created on a system. There is a first and last name field; last name is required while first name is not. When creating the user, the person will see 2 text inputs, one for first and one for last. The person chooses to only enter the last name. The first name is technically not set. During the insert I check the length of each field, setting all fields that are empty to NULL.</p>

<p>When looking at the database, I see that the first name is not set. The question that immediately comes to mind is that maybe they never saw the first name field (ie, because of an error). But this is not the case; they left if blank.</p>

<p>So, my question is, how do you decide when a field should be set to NULL or an empty string when receiving user input? How do you know that the user wants the field to be not set without detecting focus or if they deleted a value...or...or...?</p>

"36145","<p>I'm working on the development of a C++ API which uses custom-designed plugins
to interface with different database engines using their APIs and specific SQL
syntax.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm attempting to find a way of inserting BLOBs, but since <code>NULL</code> is
the terminating character in C/C++, the BLOB becomes truncated when constructing
the <em>INSERT INTO</em> query string. So far, I've worked with</p>

<pre><code>//...
char* sql;
void* blob;
int len;
//...
blob = some_blob_already_in_memory;
len = length_of_blob_already_known;
sql = sqlite3_malloc(2*len+1);
sql = sqlite3_mprintf(""INSERT INTO table VALUES (%Q)"", (char*)blob);
//...
</code></pre>

<p>I expect that, if it is at all possible to do it in the SQLite3 interactive console, it should be possible to construct the query string with properly escaped <code>NULL</code> characters. Maybe there's a way to do this with standard SQL which is also supported by SQLite SQL syntax?</p>

<p>Surely someone must have faced the same situation before. I've googled and found some answers but were in other programming languages (Python).</p>

"13552","<p>I recently posted <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/406760/whats-your-most-controversial-programming-opinion#406948"">one of my favourite interview whiteboard coding questions</a> in ""<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/406760/whats-your-most-controversial-programming-opinion"">What's your more controversial programming opinion</a>"", which is to write a function that computes Pi using the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_pi"">Leibniz formula</a>. </p>

<p>It can be approached in a number of different ways, and the exit condition takes a bit of thought, so I thought it might make an interesting code golf question. Shortest code wins!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given that Pi can be estimated using the function 4 * (1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ...) with more terms giving greater accuracy, write a function that calculates Pi to within 0.00001.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Edit: 3 Jan 2008</strong></p>

<p>As suggested in the comments I changed the exit condition to be within 0.00001 as that's what I really meant (an accuracy 5 decimal places is much harder due to rounding and so I wouldn't want to ask that in an interview, whereas within 0.00001 is an easier to understand and implement exit condition).</p>

<p>Also, to answer the comments, I guess my intention was that the solution should compute the number of iterations, or check when it had done enough, but there's nothing to prevent you from pre-computing the number of iterations and using that number. I really asked the question out of interest to see what people would come up with.</p>

"23902","<p>This should be a simple question, but I haven't been able to find a way to make it work.</p>

<p>Essentially, I have a silly localhost page that I use in my webdevelopment.  When I am surfing between our development server and my local version of the C# code (redirected from the dev url via host file) I have been known to sometimes forget what 'dev.foo.com' points at - local or server.</p>

<p>So I created a page which will run locally as my default web page's default page, so I can easily identify my localhost from the server.</p>

<p>This page does a lot of things randomly (including generating a character's starting stats for D&amp;D), including setting a random background color.  I do this by generating 3 random numbers between 0 and 255, and setting them as the RGB value for the body background color in CSS.</p>

<p>Given the 3 ints R, G, and B, how do I determine R2, G2, and B2 such that the second color will have high contrast with the first?  I like having the page have random background colors (it keeps me from getting used to the look of the landing page) but I also like to be able to read the text.</p>

"21692","<p>Aparently, encoding japanese emails is somewhat challenging, which I am slowly discovering myself. In case there are any experts (even those with limited experience will do), can I please have some guidelines as to how to do it, how to test it and how to verify it?</p>

<p>Bear in mind that I've never set foot anywhere near Japan, it is simply that the product I'm developing is used there, among other places.</p>

<p>What (I think) I know so far is following:<br>
- Japanese emails should be encoded in ISO-2022-JP, Japanese JIS codepage 50220 or possibly SHIFT_JIS codepage 932<br>
- Email transfer encoding should be set to Base64 for plain text and 7Bit for Html<br>
- Email subject should be encoded separately to start with ""=?ISO-2022-JP?B?"" (don't know what this is supposed to mean). I've tried encoding the subject with  </p>

<pre><code>""=?ISO-2022-JP?B?"" + Convert.ToBase64String(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(subject))
</code></pre>

<p>which basically gives the encoded string as expected but it doesn't get presented as any japanese text in an email program<br>
- I've tested in Outlook 2003, Outlook Express and GMail  </p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated</p>

<hr>

<p>Ok, so to post a short update, thanks to the two helpful answers, I've managed to get the right format and encoding. Now, Outlook gives something that resembles the correct subject:<br>
<code>=?iso-2022-jp?B?6  Japanese test に各々の視点で語ってもらった。  6相当の防水?=</code></p>

<p>However, the exact same email in Outlook Express gives subject like this:<br>
<code>=?iso-2022-jp?B?6  Japanese test 縺ｫ蜷・・・隕也せ縺ｧ隱槭▲縺ｦ繧ゅｉ縺｣縺溘・ 6逶ｸ蠖薙・髦ｲ豌ｴ?=</code></p>

<p>Furthermore, when viewed in the Inbox view in Outlook Express, the email subject is even more weird, like this:<br>
<code>=?iso-2022-jp?B?6  Japanese test ??????????????? 6???????=</code></p>

<p>Gmail seems to be working in the similar fashion to Outlook, which looks correct.</p>

"10429","<p>Kicking around some small structures while answering <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/414981/directly-modifying-listt-elements"">this post</a>, I came across the following unexpectedly:</p>

<p>The following structure, using an int field is perfectly legal:</p>

<pre><code>struct MyStruct
{
    public MyStruct ( int size )
    {
        this.Size = size; // &lt;-- Legal assignment.
    }

    public int Size;
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, the following structure, using an automatic property does not compile:</p>

<pre><code>struct MyStruct
{
    public MyStruct ( int size )
    {
        this.Size = size; // &lt;-- Compile-Time Error!
    }

    public int Size{get; set;}
}
</code></pre>

<p>The error returned is  ""The 'this' object cannot be used before all of its fields are assigned to"". I know that this is standard procedure for a struct: the backing field for any property must be assigned directly (and not via the property's set accessor) from within the struct's constructor. </p>

<p>A solution is to use an explicit backing field:</p>

<pre><code>struct MyStruct
{
    public MyStruct(int size)
    {
        _size = size;
    }

    private int _size;

    public int Size
    {
        get { return _size; }
        set { _size = value; }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>(Note that VB.NET would not have this issue, because in VB.NET all fields are automatically initialized to 0/null/false when first created.)</p>

<p>This would seem to be an unfortunate limitation when using automatic properties with structs in C#. Thinking conceptually, I was wondering if this wouldn't be a reasonable place for there to be an exception that allows the property set accessor to be called within a struct's constructor, at least for an automatic property?</p>

<p>This is a minor issue, almost an edge-case, but I was wondering what others thought about this...</p>

"19403","<p>In my current project, I'm producing weekly releases.  I've been using the technique described in <a href=""http://jebsoft.blogspot.com/2006/04/consistent-version-numbers-across-all.html"">this post</a> to keep the version numbers of all of the assemblies in my project in sync.

<p>When I push out a release, I build a new version of the installer.  Unlike all of the assemblies, which can get their version numbers from a shared SolutionInfo.cs file, the version number of the installer isn't, as best I can tell, an assembly property.

"42620","<p>I built a Winform app several months ago that schedules appointments for repair techs. I'd like to update the app by adding a map for the customer's address on the customer form, and then print that map on the report the techs take when they leave the office.</p>

<p>I've been looking around but I haven't found a good solution for this yet.</p>

<p>I currently have an address for the customer.  What I'd like to do is submit the address to one of the popular online map sites and get a minimap of the locale.  I can <em>almost</em> do this with Google maps using their embedded link feature.  I can get the following HTML after adding an address to their website:</p>

&lt;/iframe&gt;

<p>My first plan was to simply parse this HTML and insert whichever customer's address was needed in place this address, then show the result in a browser object on the form.  However, if I change the address in the above iframe Google gives me a ""Your client does not have permission to get URL ..."" message.</p>

"4323","<p>This is similar to a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/236414/"">previous question</a>, but the answers there don't satisfy my needs and my question is slightly different:</p>

<p>I currently use gzip compression for some very large files which contain sorted data.  When the files are not compressed, binary search is a handy and efficient way to support seeking to a location in the sorted data.</p>

<p>But when the files are compressed, things get tricky.  I recently found out about <a href=""http://www.zlib.net/"">zlib</a>'s <code>Z_FULL_FLUSH</code> option, which can be used during compression to insert ""sync points"" in the compressed output (<code>inflateSync()</code> can then begin reading from various points in the file).  This is OK, though files I already have would have to be recompressed to add this feature (and strangely <code>gzip</code> doesn't have an option for this, but I'm willing to write my own compression program if I must).</p>

<p>It seems from <a href=""http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Comp/comp.compression/2006-02/msg00327.html"">one source</a> that even <code>Z_FULL_FLUSH</code> is not a perfect solution...not only is it not supported by all gzip archives, but the very idea of detecting sync points in archives may produce false positives (either by coincidence with the magic number for sync points, or due to the fact that <code>Z_SYNC_FLUSH</code> also produces sync points but they are not usable for random access).</p>

<p>Is there a better solution?  I'd like to avoid having auxiliary files for indexing if possible, and explicit, default support for quasi-random access would be helpful (even if it's large-grained--like being able to start reading at each 10 MB interval).  Is there another compression format with better support for random reads than gzip?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: As I mentioned, I wish to do binary search in the compressed data.  I don't need to seek to a specific (uncompressed) position--only to seek with some coarse granularity within the compressed file. I just want support for something like ""Decompress the data starting roughly 50% (25%, 12.5%, etc.) of the way into this compressed file.""</p>

"14777","<p>Right now I am using this to export a repeater (with multiple nested repeaters) to excel:</p>

<pre><code>protected void ExportToExcel(object sender, EventArgs e)

Response.Clear();
Response.Buffer = true;
Response.AddHeader(""content-disposition"", ""attachment;filename=finance.xls"");
Response.Charset = """";

System.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter htmlWrite = new HtmlTextWriter(stringWrite);
rptMinistry.RenderControl(htmlWrite);
Response.Write(stringWrite.ToString());
Response.End();
}
</code></pre>

<p>But this is not doing what I want.  Instead it is giving me html in the excel file (though the data is there) this is what I get (each line is a cell in the excel sheet):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr class=""alt""&gt;
 &lt;td class='hidden'&gt;LOR In Development&lt;/td&gt;

"27805","<p>I have a WCF service hosted in IIS. The intention is for clients to make a call and receive a custom class that is defined in another project/dll. I have generated a service client using the svcutil.exe. The problem is this autogenerated client contains a new partial / proxy definition for the class I am trying to return from the service. It now throws a conversion error between my original custom class and the new partial definition at compile time. So how do you return user defined types from a WCF service? Advice appreciated.</p>

<p>The thing that bothers me most, is if I just keep hitting F5, the page WILL refresh and work as it should.  Sometimes it takes several refreshes to do this, others it happens pretty quick.  I have not been able to find a solution on the net, as most of the people with this error are upgrading from VS2005 to Web Application, and thus the fix seems to be ""Remove your app_code directory, and change the CodeFile= to CodeBehind=.  But, the CodeBehind is old, and not used anymore.  </p>

<p>In this instance, I'm getting the error on my General tab, but it can happen of ANY of my user controls when it DOES happen.  </p>

<p>Has anyone else seen this with pre-compiled pages?  I'm using VS2008 SP1.  </p>

<p>The other effect I've seen related to this is when I have a GridView setup with a datasource, and the datasource changes, but the page does not update until several other operations, then all at once all the data is filled in...  This makes me think there is some sort of cache issue, or compile-time, time-out or something...</p>

<p>I am using a site.master page, and have checked the @Page and @Master directives...  Just for the sake of argument, here are the compiler options it's using...</p>

"10077","<p>I'm working on an attendance entry form for a band.  My idea is to have a section of the form to enter event information for a performance or rehearsal.  Here's the model for the event table:</p>

    date = models.DateField()
    event_type = models.ForeignKey(EventType)
    description = models.TextField()

    member_id = models.ForeignKey(Member)
    attendance_type = models.ForeignKey(AttendanceType)
    comment = models.TextField(blank=True)

Unfortunately, Django <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thread/thread/73af9e58bd7626a8"">doesn't allow initial values in this case.</a></p>

"16940","<p>How can I best combine JQuery with ASP.NET client side validation model?</p>

<p>I've generally avoided implementing ASP.NET validation model because it always seems overkill for what I was doing. For the site I'm working on now I'm just collecting non critical user data and only need somewhat basic validation. I dont want messages appearing in the DOM or anything like that. I've always found it hard to get that to look right anyway.</p>

<p>But I need now to implement something a little more elegant. What I want to take advantage of in JQuery is clever search expressions like 'tell me if at least one of these checkboxes is checked'. I'm new to JQuery, but I think this is about 1 line of JQuery and a lot more complicated in the traditional ASP.NET model.</p>

<p>So I want to take full advantage of JQuery's abilities but not completely undemine ASP.NET's validation model.</p>

<p>My best approach so far is this (which pretty much goes behind the back of ASP.NET):</p>

<pre><code>$('#&lt;%=btnJoinMailingList.ClientID %&gt;').bind('click', function(event) {

   if (...) {
       alert(""You must enter a name"");
       return false;
   }
   return true;
});

"57120","<p>Original Question:</p>

<p>We have an odd error with WebResource.axd url generation.  (It does not seem to be related to the fairly common ""WebRsource.axd Padding is invalid and cannot be removed"" issue).</p>

<p>We have an ASP.NET web page that, when created, adds a script reference to WebResource.axd.</p>

<p>In this case, we're seeing that the WebResource.axd link occasionally turns into garbage past a certain point, replaced by what looks like javascript.  Worse yet, the url generation failure seems to be inconsistant.</p>

<p>In our case, the link should (and usually <em>does</em> look like):</p>

<pre><code>/WebResource.axd?d=D-wd7RbHCvSp_p0mHAmE4g2&amp;amp;t=633464867255568315
</code></pre>

<p>All well and good.  However, we are getting errors logged from users...and the url they're trying to access looks like (in one case):</p>

<pre><code>/WebResource.axd?d=D-wd7RbHCvS/../../images/icons/Ico_resize.gif')}}function%20ShowFilter_Manufacturer(){var%20div.......
</code></pre>

<p>[the remaining encoded javascript from that link has been removed as irrelevant]</p>

<p>Stranger yet, we got a few of these in rapid succession from the same user, who was apparently trying to reload the page...each url slightly different.</p>

<pre><code>/WebResource.axd?d=D-wd7RbHCvS&lt;garbage&gt;
/WebResource.axd?d=D-wd7RbHCvSp&lt;garbage&gt;
/WebResource.axd?d=D-wd7RbHCvSp_&lt;garbage&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In some cases the garbage is encoded JavaScript, I've seen portions of a url...completely empty parameter strings...I don't see an obvious pattern.</p>

<p>As an aside, should it be relevant, it should be noted that I don't believe that this WebResource is anything other than a stock WebResource that is automatically included by .NET when certain features are included on a page...in this case, a field validator.  Looking at the contents of the actual WebResource.axd reveals very standard looking set of Javascript functions that seem designed to handle generic .NET events.  Not anything we've created.  </p>

<p>Has anyone seen anything like this?  (or better, has anyone understood why this was happening, and come up with a way to eliminate it?)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 0:</strong> Some additional information:</p>

<p>Item 1: In response to one answer, we made sure that our scripts are encased with CDATA tags, since our doctype is xhtml transitional:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, though we had high hopes, it does not seem to have solved the problem.  We've noticed this more often with IE 8 as a browser, which would lend some credence to the idea that this is browser related...perhaps the way the browser is parsing the stream...but why we would get subtly different responses on subsequent attempts baffles me.</p>

<p>Item 2:
It turns out that the omitted sections seem to be blocks of fairly regular size.  Someone reported that he was seeing 1k or 4k blocks missing, and I (so far...I've only looked at two cases thus far) would agree (mine were both missing 4096 bytes of data).</p>
"
"13940","<p>I've frequently seen a space preceding the closing slash in XML and HTML tags. The XHTML line break is probably the canonical example:</p>

<p>I've read that the space solves some ""backwards compatibility issues."" Which backwards compatibility issues? Are those issues still relevant, or are we still adding extra spaces for the sake of, say, IE3 compatibility? Does there exist some spec with the definitive answer on this?</p>

<p>If not backwards compatibility, then is it a readability issue? Similar to the Great Open Curly Brace debate?</p>

"17744","<p>I feel like I'm running around in circles. I can't seem to make up my mind as to what the right repository pattern is using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query#LINQ_to_SQL"">LINQ to SQL</a>. If you're familiar with <a href=""http://blog.wekeroad.com/"">Rob Conery's</a> <a href=""http://www.codeplex.com/mvcsamples/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=18861"">MVC Storefront</a> you will see that his implementation wraps the LINQ-generated models with another class and treats the LINQ-generated one simply as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object"">data transfer object</a> (DTO). It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>//Custom wrapper class.
namespace Data
{
    public class Customer
    {
         public int Id {get;set;}
         public string Name {get;set;}

    }
}

//Linq-Generated Class - severly abbreviated

    {
         public int Id {get;set;}
         public string Name {get;set;}

    }
}

//Customer Repository

        {
            return
                from c in _db.Customers
                select new Customer // This is the wrapper class not the gen'd one
                {
                   Id = c.Id,
                   Name = c.Name,
                   Addresses = new LazyList(c.Addresses)
                };
        }

<p>What is the advantage of doing it this way (using a wrapper class), as opposed to the way Mike Hadlow suggests in <em><a href=""http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2008/03/using-irepository-pattern-with-linq-to.html"">Using the IRepository pattern with LINQ to SQL</a></em> in his version of IRepository&lt;T> where he just returns the DTO objects from the repository?</p>

<p>Where should the business logic be enforced and checked? Is this in a seperate layer all together called by the repository on save/update, or is it built-in to the wrapper class?</p>

"1862","<p>Why was it decided that using <strong>XMLHTTPRequest</strong> for doing XML calls should not do calls across the domain boundary?  You can retrieve JavaScript, images, CSS, iframes, and just about any other content I can think of from other domains. Why are the Ajax HTTP requests not allowed to cross the domain boundaries?  It seems like an odd limitation to put, considering the only way I could see it being abused, would be if someone were to inject Javascript into the page.  However, in this case, you could simply add an img, script, or iframe element to the document to get it to request the third party URL and send it to the server.  </p>

<p>[Edit] </p>

<p>Some of the answers point out the following reasons, let's point out the reasons they don't  create a major reason to disallow this.</p>

<h2>XSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery, also known as CSRF, XSRF)</h2>

<p>Your can do XSRF attacks without using this at all.  As a general rule, XMLHTTPRequest isn't used at all, simply because it's so hard to make an XMLHTTPRequest in a way that's compatible with all major browsers.  It's much easier to just add an img tag to the URL if you want them to load your URL.</p>

<h2>Posting to third party site</h2>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
  $.post(""http://some-bank.com/transfer-money.php"",
         { amount: ""10000"", to_account: ""xxxx"" })
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Could be accomplished with</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body onload=""document.getElementById('InvisbleForm').submit()""
    &lt;div style=""display:none""&gt;
        &lt;form id=""InvisbleForm"" action=""http://some-bank.com/transfer-money.php"" method=""POST""&gt;
            &lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""amount"" value=""10000""&gt;
            &lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""to_account"" value=""xxxxx""&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

<h2>JPunyon: why would you leave the vulnerability in a new feature</h2>

<p>You aren't creating any more insecurities.  You are just inconveniencing developers who want to use it in a way for good.  Anybody who wants to use this feature for evil (aka awesome) could just use some other method of doing it.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I'm marking the answer from <strong>bobince</strong> as correct because he pointed out the critical problem.  Because XMLHTTPRequest allows you to post, with credentials (cookies) to the destination site, and read the data sent back from the site, along with sending the persons credentials, you could orchestrate some javascript that would submit a series of forms, including confirmation forms, complete with any random keys generated that were put in place to try to prevent a XSRF.  In this way, you could browse through the target site, like a bank, and the bank's webserver would be unable to tell that it wasn't just a regular user submitting all these forms.</p>

"51659","<p>I have created a program which searches for files in a source folder. If it finds any file, it processes that file and moves it to a destination folder, then looks for a new file in the source folder. It has to keep on checking the source folder for a file.</p>

<p>I have used a thread to look for files in the source folder. The problem I am facing is whenever any exception is thrown during file processing, the thread gets stopped. I want the thread to be running even if an exception is thrown. It has to move the file that caused the error to some other folder and look for a new file in the source folder. How can I make the thread keep on running?</p>

"41283","<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I apologize everybody. I used the term ""jagged array"" when I actually meant to say ""multi-dimensional array"" (as can be seen in my example below). I apologize for using the incorrect name. I actually found jagged arrays to be faster than multi-dimensional ones! I have added my measurements for jagged arrays.</p>

<p>I was trying to use a <del>jagged</del> multi-dimensional array today, when I noticed that it's performance is not as I would have expected. Using a single-dimensional array and manually calculating indices was much faster (almost two times) than using a 2D array. I wrote a test using  <code>1024*1024</code> arrays (initialized to random values), for 1000 iterations, and I got the following results on my machine:</p>

<pre><code>sum(double[], int): 2738 ms (100%)
sum(double[,]):     5019 ms (183%)
sum(double[][]):    2540 ms ( 93%)
</code></pre>

<p>This is my test code:</p>

<pre><code>public static double sum(double[] d, int l1) {
    // assuming the array is rectangular
    double sum = 0;
    int l2 = d.Length / l1;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; l1; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; l2; ++j)
            sum += d[i * l2 + j];
    return sum;
}

public static double sum(double[,] d) {
    double sum = 0;
    int l1 = d.GetLength(0);
    int l2 = d.GetLength(1);
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; l1; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; l2; ++j)
            sum += d[i, j];
    return sum;
}

public static double sum(double[][] d) {
    double sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; d.Length; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; d[i].Length; ++j)
            sum += d[i][j];
    return sum;
}

public static void Main() {
    Random random = new Random();
    const int l1  = 1024, l2 = 1024;
    double[ ] d1  = new double[l1 * l2];
    double[,] d2  = new double[l1 , l2];
    double[][] d3 = new double[l1][];

        d3[i] = new double[l2];
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; l2; ++j)
            d3[i][j] = d2[i, j] = d1[i * l2 + j] = random.NextDouble();
    }
    //
    const int iterations = 1000;

}
</code></pre>

<p>Further investigation showed that the IL for the second method is 23% larger than that of the first method. (Code size 68 vs 52.) This is mostly due to calls to <code>System.Array::GetLength(int)</code>. The compiler also emits calls to <code>Array::Get</code> for the <del>jagged</del> multi-dimensional array, whereas it simply calls <code>ldelem</code> for the simple array.</p>

<p>So I am wondering, why is access through multi-dimensional arrays slower than normal arrays? I would have assumed the compiler (or JIT) would do something similar to what I did in my first method, but this was not actually the case.</p>

<p>Could you plese help me understand why this is happening the way it is?</p>

"
"11098","<p>A colleague and I designed a system for our customer, and in our opinion we created a nice clean design. But I'm having problems with some coupling we've introduced. I could try to create an example design which includes the same problems as our design, but if you forgive me I'll create an extract of our design to support the question.</p>

<p>We're developing a system for the registration of certain treatments for a patients. To avoid having a broken link to image I'll describe the conceptual UML class diagram as a c# style class definition.</p>

<pre><code>class Discipline {}
class ProtocolKind
{
   Discipline;
}
class Protocol
{
   ProtocolKind;
   ProtocolMedication; //1..*
}
class ProtocolMedication
{
   Medicine;
}
class Medicine
{
   AdministrationRoute;
}
class AdministrationRoute {}
</code></pre>

<p>I'll try to explain a bit about the design, a protocol is the template for a new treatment. And a protocol is of a certain Kind and has medications which need to be administered. Per protocol the dosage can differ for the same medicine (amongst other things), so that's stored in the ProtocolMedication class. AdministrationRoute is the way the medicine is administered and iscreated/updated separately from the protocol management.</p>

<p>I've found the following places which we'll have a violation of the Law of Demeter:</p>

<h2>Violations of the Law of Demeter</h2>

<h3>Inside of the BLL</h3>

<p>For example, inside the business logic of the ProtocolMedication there are rules which depend on the AdministrationRoute.Soluble property of the medicine. The code would become</p>

<pre><code>if (!Medicine.AdministrationRoute.Soluble)
{
   //validate constrains on fields
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Inside the repositories</h3>

<p>A method which would list all the protocols in a certain Discipline would be written as:</p>

<pre><code>public IQueryable&lt;Protocol&gt; ListQueryable(Discipline discipline)
{
    return ListQueryable().Where(p =&gt; (p.Kind.Discipline.Id == discipline.Id)); // Entity Frameworks needs you to compare the Id...
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Inside the User Interface</h3>

<p>We use ASP.NET (no MVC) for the interface of our system, in my opinion this layer currently has the worst violations. The databinding of a gridview (a column which must display the Discipline of a protocol must bind to Kind.Discipline.Name), which are strings, <strong>so no compile time errors</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:TemplateField HeaderText=""Discipline"" SortExpression=""Kind.Discipline.Name""&gt;
   &lt;ItemTemplate&gt;
      &lt;%# Eval(""Kind.Discipline.Name"")%&gt;
   &lt;/ItemTemplate&gt;
&lt;/asp:TemplateField&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So I think the actual question might be, when would it be okay to look at it more as the Suggestion of Demeter, and what can be done to solve the violations of the Law of Demeter?</p>

<p><em>I've got a few idea's of myself but I'll post them as answers so they can be commented and voted on seperatly. (I'm not sure this is the SO way to do it, if not, I'll delete my answers and add them to the question).</em></p>

"21186","<p>Edit: Based on the answer from LoveMeSomeCode, I believe this issue only appears in VB.Net.</p>

<p>I'm trying to revert a class to a previous state by saving the old values of changed properties in a dictionary and setting them via reflection when I need to revert. I'm having a problem where if the old value is Nothing (null) I get a null reference exception when trying to set the property. Here's what I've tried.</p>

<p>Assume a for each loop like this:</p>

<pre><code>For Each pair As KeyValuePair(Of String, Object) In myOldValues
...
Next
</code></pre>

<p>Method 1:</p>

<pre><code>CallByName(Me, pair.Key, CallType.Set, pair.Value)
</code></pre>

<p>Method 2:</p>

<pre><code>Me.GetType().InvokeMember(pair.Key, Reflection.BindingFlags.SetProperty, Nothing, Me, pair.Value)
</code></pre>

<p>Method 3:</p>

<pre><code>Dim propInfo As System.Reflection.PropertyInfo = Me.GetType.GetProperty(pair.Key)
propInfo.SetValue(Me, Convert.ChangeType(pair.Value, propInfo.PropertyType), Nothing)
</code></pre>

<p>For each of these methods I get a null reference exception when pair.Value is null. The setter is capable of holding a null value (frequently the property is a string). What am I doing wrong or how can I work around it?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Each method fails if I pass it null directly as well.</p>

<p>Specifically, I seem to be able to get the ""Auth"" token correctly, but attempts to use it in the header when I access later pages still just return me the login page's HTML.</p>

<p>Following links related to this post, I've determined that you need to make a subsequent call to <a href=""http://yourapp.appspot.com/_ah/login"" rel=""nofollow"">this URL</a>.</p>

<p>A call to the URL will then give you an ACSID cookie which then needs to be passed in subsequent calls in order to maintain an authenticated state. </p>

<p>When requesting this cookie, I've read various posts saying you need to specify your original auth token by appending it to the query string such that: </p>

<pre><code>?auth=this_is_my_token

<p>I've also read that you should set it in the http header as described in <a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/auth.html#ClientLogin"" rel=""nofollow"">google's documentation</a> such that a http header name/value is: </p>

<pre><code>Authorization: GoogleLogin auth=yourAuthToken

<p>I've tried both approaches and am not seeing any cookies returned. I've used Wireshark, LiveHttpHeaders for Firefox, and simple NSLog statements trying to see if anything like this is returned. </p>

//show me all header fields

"56763","<p>Im looking for an algorithm to be used in a racing game Im making. The map/level/track is randomly generated so I need to find two locations, start and goal, that makes use of the most of the map.</p>

<ul>
<li>The algorithm is to work inside a two dimensional space</li>
<li>From each point, one can only traverse to the next point in four directions; up, down, left, right</li>
<li>Points can only be either blocked or nonblocked, only nonblocked points can be traversed</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding the calculation of distance, it should not be the ""bird path"" for a lack of a better word. The path between A and B should be longer if there is a wall (or other blocking area) between them.</p>

<p>Im unsure on where to start, comments are very welcome and proposed solutions are preferred in pseudo code.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Right. After looking through <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/477591/algorithm-to-find-two-points-furthest-away-from-each-other#478076"">gs's code I gave it another shot. Instead of python, I this time wrote it in C++. But still, even after reading up on Dijkstras algorithm</a>, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill"">floodfill</a> and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/477591/algorithm-to-find-two-points-furthest-away-from-each-other#477627"">Hosam Alys solution</a>, I fail to spot any crucial difference. My code still works, but not as fast as you seem to be getting yours to run. Full source is on <a href=""http://pastie.org/370724"">pastie</a>. The only interesting lines (I guess) is the Dijkstra variant itself on lines 78-118.</p>

<p>But speed is not the main issue here. I would really appreciate the help if someone would be kind enough to point out the differences in the algorithms.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Hosam Alys algorithm, is the only difference that he scans from the borders instead of every node?</li>
<li>In Dijkstras you keep track and overwrite the distance walked, but not in floodfill, but thats about it?</li>

<p>I want to make a game with pygame incorporating a wiimote.  I found <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82407&amp;package_id=259597"" rel=""nofollow"">pywiiuse</a> which is a very basic wrapper for the <a href=""http://www.wiiuse.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">wiiuse</a> library using c types.</p>

<p>I can NOT get anything beyond LEDs and vibrating to work.  Buttons, IR, motion sensing, nothing.  I've tried different versions of wiiuse, pywiiuse, even python.  I can't even get the examples that came with it to run.  Here's the code I made as a simple test.  I copied some of the example C++ code.</p>

<pre><code>from pywiiuse import *
from time     import sleep

#Init
wiimotes = wiiuse_init()

#Find and start the wiimote
found    = wiiuse_find(wiimotes,1,5)

#Make the variable wiimote to the first wiimote init() found
wiimote  = wiimotes.contents

#Set Leds
wiiuse_set_leds(wiimote,WIIMOTE_LED_1)

#Rumble for 1 second
wiiuse_rumble(wiimote,1)
sleep(1)
wiiuse_rumble(wiimote,0)

#Turn motion sensing on(supposedly)
wiiuse_motion_sensing(wiimote,1)

while 1:
    #Poll the wiimotes to get the status like pitch or roll
    if(wiiuse_poll(wiimote,1)):
        print 'EVENT'

"36330","<p>Finding routes for a car is pretty easy: you store a weighted graph of all the roads and you could use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djikstra%27s_algorithm"">Djikstra's algorithm</a> [1]. A bus route is less obvious. With a bus you have to represent things like ""wait 10 minutes for the next bus"" or ""walk one block to another bus stop"" and feed those into your pathfinding algorithm.</p>

<p>It's not even always simple for cars. In some cities, some roads are one-way-only into the city in the morning, and one-way-only out of the city in the evening. Some advanced GPSs know how to avoid busy routes during rush hour.</p>

<p>How would you efficiently represent this kind of time-dependent graph and find a route? There is no need for a provably optimal solution; if the traveler wanted to be on time, they would buy a car. ;-)</p>

<p>I started with the <code>FileDownload</code> event of <code>WebBrowser</code>, but it does not allow cancellation. Then, I used the approach from <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cpp/ExtendedWebBrowser.aspx?fid=285594&amp;select=2560552"">CodeProject: Extended .NET 2.0 WebBrowser Control</a> to implement my own event based on the original COM call using the interface <code>DWebBrowserEvents2</code>. When I fixed the code according to <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/?scid=kb%3Ben-us%3B325204&amp;x=15&amp;y=12"">an MS knowledge base entry about a bug with the FileDownload signature</a>, the event handler was called and I was able to cancel the download.</p>

<p>This does not work with all downloads, though: download URLs pointing to an URL including <code>.exe</code> raise the event and can be cancelled before the dialog appears - but for others (like <code>.do</code>), the event handler is not called until the user clicks <code>Open</code>, <code>Save</code> or <code>Cancel</code> in the dialog.</p>

<p>A possible solution might be to <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/shell/WebBrowserControlDialogs.aspx"">intercept <code>WH_CALLWNDPROCRET</code> messages and 'answer' the dialog before it is shown to the user</a>, but it sounds like much effort and I also would prefer a cleaner solution...</p>

"60442","<p>I'm trying to work out the ""correct"" way to handle populating an array with key-value coding for an iPhone app.  I've come up with something that works, but it's fairly hackish.  Basically I'm parsing an XML document into a set of code-generated models.  Let's assume the XML is of this format:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;foo&gt;
    &lt;bar&gt;
        &lt;item name=""baz"" /&gt;
        &lt;item name=""bog"" /&gt;
    &lt;/bar&gt;
&lt;/foo&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>On my generated object that represents the Bar element, I have an NSMutableArray defined for the sub-node:</p>

<pre><code>@interface Bar : NSObject {
    NSMutableArray *item;
}
@end
</code></pre>

<p>So by default when I call setValue:forKey: on an instance of Bar, it ends up overwriting the instance of NSMutableArray with a single instance of the Item object.  What I've currently done to get this working is where it gets hacky.  I renamed the array instance variable to be something else, let's say the plural form of the name:</p>

<pre><code>@interface Bar : NSObject {
    NSMutableArray *items;
}
@end
</code></pre>

<p>This causes the default accessor for setValue:forKey: to miss.  I then added this method to the Bar implementation:    </p>

<pre><code>- (void)setValue:(id)value forUndefinedKey:(NSString *)key {
    if([key isEqualToString:@""item""]) {
        if(items == nil) {
            items = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
            [items retain];
        }
        [items addObject:value];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And everything works!  I'm sure there must be a better way to do this though!  I've read through the Key-Value Coding Programming Guide, but I must be missing something, because I'm unclear as to how things are supposed to work for array accessors.  I've tried implementing countOf: and objectInAtIndex: as they KVC Programming guide seems to indicate, but that still results with my NSMutableArray being overwritten with an instance of the Item type.</p>

<p>The problem is that there are other transactions happening that consume quantity from our inventory, so between the time that the record is selected and the updates are written in transaction A that record could become an invalid selection because it's quantity might have been lowered below the threshold in the WHERE clause.</p>

"1288","<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/487906/java-phone-number-format-api"">This question</a> asking for a phone number format API in Java got me wondering why such an API doesn't seem to exist.  Given the number of <a href=""http://commons.apache.org/validator/apidocs/org/apache/commons/validator/routines/package-summary.html#package_description"">validation</a> classes available under <a href=""http://commons.apache.org/"">Apache Commons</a>, I would have thought such an API would be included.</p>

<p>My question is, does anyone know of a phone number formatting/validation library available in <strong>any language</strong> that could be used as a model for a small Java open source project?  Also, other than the large number of different phone number formats used throughout the world, does anyone know of any reason that such a project would be infeasible?</p>

"7708","<p>In a simulation server environment where users are allowed to submit their own code to be run by the server, it would clearly be advantageous for any user-submitted code to be run in side a sandbox, not unlike Applets are within a browser.

<p>This kind of limitation appears to be possible using the existing Java sandbox model, but is there a dynamic way to enable that for just the user-submitted parts of a running application?</p>

"","<p>I have a scenario where I have a WPF TreeView control that has an <code>HierarchicalDataTemplate</code> for its items.

"16940","<p>I am having a minor problem with WCF service proxies where the message contains <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code> as a parameter.</p>

<p>I am using the 'Add Service reference' in Visual Studio to generate a reference to my service.</p>

<pre><code>   // portion of my web service message
   public List&lt;SubscribeInfo&gt; Subscribe { get; set; }
   public List&lt;string&gt; Unsubscribe { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>These are the generated properties on my <code>MsgIn</code> for one of my web methods.
You can see it used <code>ArrayOfString</code> when I am using <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code>, and the other takes <code>List&lt;SubscribeInfo&gt;</code> - which matches my original C# object above.</p>

<pre><code>[System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute(EmitDefaultValue=false)]
public System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;DataAccess.MailingListWSReference.SubscribeInfo&gt; Subscribe {
    get {
        return this.SubscribeField;
    }
    set {
        if ((object.ReferenceEquals(this.SubscribeField, value) != true)) {
            this.SubscribeField = value;
            this.RaisePropertyChanged(""Subscribe"");
        }
    }
}

[System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute(EmitDefaultValue=false)]
publicDataAccess.MailingListWSReference.ArrayOfString Unsubscribe {

            this.UnsubscribeField = value;
            this.RaisePropertyChanged(""Unsubscribe"");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The ArrayOfString class generated looks like this. This is a class generated in my code - its not a .NET class. It actually generated me a class that inherits from List, but didn't have the 'decency' to create me any constructors.</p>

<pre><code>    [System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThroughAttribute()]
    [System.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCodeAttribute(""System.Runtime.Serialization"", ""3.0.0.0"")]

    [System.SerializableAttribute()]
    public class ArrayOfString : System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;string&gt; {
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that I often create my message like this :</p>

<pre><code>client.UpdateMailingList(new UpdateMailingListMsgIn()
{
    Email = model.Email,
    Name = model.Name,
    Source = Request.Url.ToString(),
    Subscribe = subscribeTo.ToList(),
    Unsubscribe = unsubscribeFrom.ToList()
});
</code></pre>

<p>I really like the clean look this gives me.</p>

<p>Now for the actual problem :</p>

<p>I cant assign a <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code> to the <code>Unsubscribe</code> property which is an <code>ArrayOfString</code>  - even though it inherits from List. In fact I cant seem to find ANY way to assign it without extra statements.</p>

<p>I've tried the following :</p>

<ul>
<li><code>new ArrayOfString(unsubscribeFrom.ToList())</code>  - this constructor doesn't exist :-(</li>
<li>changing the type of the array used by the code generator   -  doesn't work - it always gives me ArrayOfString (!?)</li>
<li>try to cast <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code> to <code>ArrayOfString</code>   - fails with 'unable to cast', even though it compiles just fine </li>
<li>create <code>new ArrayOfString()</code> and then <code>AddRange(unsubscribeFrom.ToList())</code>   -  works, but I cant do it all in one statement</li>
<li>create a conversion function <code>ToArrayOfString(List&lt;string&gt;)</code>, which works but isn't as clean as I want.</li>
</ul>

<p>Its only doing this for string, which is annoying.</p>

<p>Am i missing something? Is there a way to tell it not to generate <code>ArrayOfString</code> - or some other trick to assign it ?</p>

"50031","<p>I have a calculated measure in Analysis Services that returns the average daily revenue for a location based on their last three periods.  Periods are location defined lengths of time, so one location may close their periods monthly, and another may close their periods quarterly.</p>

<p>To return the average daily revenue I have a factPeriods table that returns the revenue for a period, and the number of days that contribute to the period.  The following MDX returns the correct values at the location level, ([Measures].[Days In AR Charges]) / ([Measures].[Days In AR Days]).</p>

<p>The  problem is when I roll up to higher levels, say I want to return the average daily revenue by state, the calculation is incorrect because it first aggregates the days contributing to the periods, then divides.  I want the averaging to happen at the lowest level first, then to sum the results of the daily average revenue.  Here is an example of what happens vs what I would like to happen.</p>

<p>Say I have only two locations, A and B.  A closes monthly, B closes quarterly.  The results for the last close are:
</p>

<p>Location  /  Revenue  /  Days contributing to revenue</p>

<p>Location A  /  $3000  /  30 days
Location B  /  $1800  /  90 days</p>

<p>Location A is generating $100/day revenue, Location B is generating only $20/day in revenue.  My total should be $120 day.  Instead, it would return $40/day.  Here is what happens at the calculation level.</p>

<p>I would like the formula to be in pseudocode SUM(([Measures].[Days In AR Charges]) / ([Measures].[Days In AR Days]))</p>

<p>but it is actually giving me (SUM([Measures].[Days In AR Charges])) / (SUM([Measures].[Days In AR Days]))</p>

<p>Can anyone help me determine the appropriate formula to make this work as desired?  It should end up being $100/day + $20/day, not $4800/120 days.  I have a suspicious I may need to use descendants but I am not clear on exactly how I would use them, or if that is even the right direction to go.</p>

<p>Thanks, Egil.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Turns out that this is in fact a IE8 thing, at least the version in the Windows 7 beta. I put up a test page (<a href=""http://egil.dk/popuptest/popup-source.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://egil.dk/popuptest/popup-source.htm</a>) and it seems to work as expected in from my colleagues IE7. Gah, time wasted!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> I should probably tell how to reproduce the error. Go to <a href=""http://egil.dk/popuptest/popup-source.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://egil.dk/popuptest/popup-source.htm</a>, click on one of the links, i.e. ""something 1"", after the popup finishes loading, tab back to to parent window, and click on the same link again. This time, the popup window will just receive focus again, and NOT reload (this is intentionally and what I want). Now close the popup window, and then click on the same link again. This produces the error in the IE8 beta. In Firefox it correctly reopens.</p>

"32240","<p>A DB design question: when do you decide to use 1 to 1 relation tables?</p>

<p>One of the places I see this is, for example, when you have a User and UserProfile table, people split them instead of putting all columns just in a User table.</p>

<p>Technically, you can just put all the columns in one table since their relationship is 1-to-1.  </p>

<p>I know someone said that for the UserProfile table, over time you need to alter table to add more columns, but I really don't think this is a strong reason to split the tables.</p>

"","<p>I have written some VBScripts to automate tasks that I perform on computers over the network.  These work great for most tasks however within our network we have problems with the IP address in DNS being correct all the time.

<p>For example a machine may boot up wired in the morning and get an IP address:  10.10.10.1</p>

<p>When it switches to wireless it will obtain an address in a different subnet: 10.11.10.1</p>

<p>When you try to connect to that machine it still returns the old IP address (10.10.10.1) even though the computer now has a new one.</p>

<p>I have found that I can still connect to that computer's C$ share via \computer name\c$ even though the machine does not ping.  Obviously there is some other kind of address resolution going on, my question is how do I harness this to allow my VBScripts connect to WMI?</p>

<p>Sorry for the waffly title - if I could come up with a concise title, I wouldn't have to ask the question.</p>

<p>Suppose I have an immutable list type. It has an operation <code>Foo(x)</code> which returns a new immutable list with the specified argument as an extra element at the end. So to build up a list of strings with values ""Hello"", ""immutable"", ""world"" you could write:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>var empty = new ImmutableList&lt;string&gt;();
var list1 = empty.Foo(""Hello"");
var list2 = list1.Foo(""immutable"");
var list3 = list2.Foo(""word"");
</code></pre>

<p>(This is C# code, and I'm most interested in a C# suggestion if you feel the language is important. It's not fundamentally a language question, but the idioms of the language may be important.)</p>

<p>The important thing is that the existing lists are <em>not</em> altered by <code>Foo</code> - so <code>empty.Count</code> would still return 0.</p>

<p>Another (more idiomatic) way of getting to the end result would be:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>var list = new ImmutableList&lt;string&gt;().Foo(""Hello"")
                                      .Foo(""immutable"")
                                      .Foo(""word"");
</code></pre>

<p>My question is: <strong>what's the best name for Foo?</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong>: As I reveal later on, the name of the type might not actually be <code>ImmutableList&lt;T&gt;</code>, which makes the position clear. Imagine instead that it's <code>TestSuite</code> and that it's immutable because the whole of the framework it's a part of is immutable...</p>

<p>(End of edit 3)</p>

<p>Options I've come up with so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Add</code>: common in .NET, but implies mutation of the original list</li>
<li><code>Cons</code>: I believe this is the normal name in functional languages, but meaningless to those without experience in such languages</li>
<li><code>Plus</code>: my favourite so far, it doesn't imply mutation <em>to me</em>. Apparently this is also <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/MonadPlus"">used in Haskell</a> but with slightly different expectations (a Haskell programmer might expect it to add two lists together rather than adding a single value to the other list).</li>
<li><code>With</code>: consistent with some other immutable conventions, but doesn't have quite the same ""additionness"" to it IMO.</li>
<li><code>And</code>: not very descriptive.</li>
<li>Operator overload for + : I really don't like this much; I generally think operators should only be applied to lower level types. I'm willing to be persuaded though!</li>
</ul>

<p>The criteria I'm using for choosing are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gives the correct impression of the result of the method call (i.e. that it's the original list with an extra element)</li>
<li>Makes it as clear as possible that it doesn't mutate the existing list</li>
<li>Sounds reasonable when chained together as in the second example above</li>
</ul>

<p>Please ask for more details if I'm not making myself clear enough...</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong> Here's my reasoning for preferring <code>Plus</code> to <code>Add</code>. Consider these two lines of code:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>list.Add(foo);
list.Plus(foo);
</code></pre>

<p>In my view (and this <em>is</em> a personal thing) the latter is clearly buggy - it's like writing ""x + 5;"" as a statement on its own. The first line looks like it's okay, until you remember that it's immutable. In fact, the way that the plus operator on its own doesn't mutate its operands is another reason why <code>Plus</code> is my favourite. Without the slight ickiness of operator overloading, it still gives the same connotations, which include (for me) not mutating the operands (or method target in this case).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> Reasons for not liking Add.</p>

<p>Various answers are effectively: ""Go with Add. That's what <code>DateTime</code> does, and <code>String</code> has <code>Replace</code> methods etc which don't make the immutability obvious."" I agree - there's precedence here. However, I've seen plenty of people call <code>DateTime.Add</code> or <code>String.Replace</code> and <em>expect mutation</em>. There are loads of newsgroup questions (and probably SO ones if I dig around) which are answered by ""You're ignoring the return value of <code>String.Replace</code>; strings are immutable, a new string gets returned.""</p>

<p>Now, I should reveal a subtlety to the question - the type might <em>not</em> actually be an immutable list, but a different immutable type. In particular, I'm working on a benchmarking framework where you add tests to a suite, and that creates a new suite. It might be obvious that:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>var list = new ImmutableList&lt;string&gt;();
list.Add(""foo"");
</code></pre>

<p>isn't going to accomplish anything, but it becomes a <em>lot</em> murkier when you change it to:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>var suite = new TestSuite&lt;string, int&gt;();
suite.Add(x =&gt; x.Length);
</code></pre>

<p>That looks like it should be okay. Whereas this, to me, makes the mistake clearer:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>var suite = new TestSuite&lt;string, int&gt;();
suite.Plus(x =&gt; x.Length);
</code></pre>

<p>That's just begging to be:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>var suite = new TestSuite&lt;string, int&gt;().Plus(x =&gt; x.Length);
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally, I would like my users not to have to be told that the test suite is immutable. I want them to fall into the pit of success. This <em>may</em> not be possible, but I'd like to try.</p>

<p>I apologise for over-simplifying the original question by talking only about an immutable list type. Not all collections are quite as self-descriptive as <code>ImmutableList&lt;T&gt;</code> :)</p>

<p>What is the best way to write this document (a header, a logo, and a table with parameters and pass/fail limits) from Python?</p>

<p>HTMLGen?</p>

<p>Or is there a better, newer Python package?  </p>

<p>I can write my own package to write HTML, but surely someone else has done this already.</p>

"19036","<p>I've read a great deal of discussion recently (both on this site and elsewhere) about ""friendly URLs"" but I'm not sure what exactly makes a URL ""friendly"" and why we really even care (up to a certain point).  Illustration:</p>

<p>The following is an example of a URL that would be held up by the majority of current web developers as ""friendly"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>www.myblog.com/posts/123/this-is-the-name-of-my-blog-post</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whereas this would be considered ""unfriendly"" (i.e. bad, Neanderthal, ignorant, stupid):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>www.myblog.com/posts.aspx?id=123</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Doesn't the ""friendly"" URL contain duplicate identifying information about the blog post in question?  In other words, once you have the id (123) of the post, why do you need the title?  Wouldn't this be a violation of the ""don't repeat yourself"" mantra?</li>
<li>What difference does the form of a URL make as far as users are concerned?  Do users ever actually <strong>type</strong> full URLs by hand (other than the TLD, of course)?  Do users ever look to the URL of a page to determine what the page is about?  Why do we need the title of the blog post in the URL?  Isn't that what the page's <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag and content are for?</li>
<li>I often hear SEO as a reason why the ""friendly"" URL form is preferred.  Why does a search engine spider care about the URL?  Aren't they just automated pieces of software that crawl pages (and the links to other pages that are contained within them)?  If search engines were written like other software components (e.g. database access components), the URL would just be a meaningless identifier (similar to a rowguid in a relational database) to them. If I were designing a database schema with something like the ""friendly"" URL above as a table's primary key, I would (quite correctly) get chewed out.</li>
</ul>

<p>I said earlier ""up to a point"" because obviously, URLs can get out of hand.  Here is an actual URL from Amazon.com that I don't think anyone in their right mind would consider ""friendly"":</p>

"21499","<p>Since the trigonometric functions in java.lang.Math are quite slow: is there a library that does a quick and good approximation? It seems possible to do a calculation several times faster without losing much precision. (On my machine a multiplication takes 1.5ns, and java.lang.Math.sin 46ns to 116ns). Unfortunately there is not yet a way to use the hardware functions.</p>

<p>UPDATE: The functions should be accurate enough, say, for GPS calculations. That means you would need at least 7 decimal digits accuracy, which rules out simple lookup tables. And it should be much faster than java.lang.Math.sin on your basic x86 system. Otherwise there would be no point in it.</p>

<p>For values over pi/4 Java does <a href=""http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4857011"">some expensive computations</a> in addition to the hardware functions. It does so for a good reason, but sometimes you care more about the speed than for last bit accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>A side note:</strong> Just for the hell of it, I paste that XML into XML Notepad 2007, it tells me:</p>

<p>Your XML document contains no xml-stylesheet processing instruction. To provide an XSLT transform, add the following to the top of your file and edit the href attribute accordingly:</p>

<p></p>

<p>I don't think that really means it's malformed or anything but just something to note.</p>

<p><strong>So..</strong></p>

<p>My ultimate goal is to get pass this damn error obviously and get an array of albums back using my code above once I can get past the error.  I also want to make sure my code is correct in trying to retrieve that arrray back of albums using my Album[] property in my Album class or anything else I might be missing here.  I think it's pretty close and should work but it's not. </p>

<hr>

<p>Follow-up.  I've been pulling my hair out since then.</p>

<p>Here's the latest.  I did not use some things for now (from Marc) like the Enum, etc.  I might change that later.  I also pulled out the datetime stuff as it just looked wierd and I did not get errors on that anway without...at least yet.  The main problem now is still my damn XML.</p>

<p>It's still appearing to have problems with the format I guess?  Unless it's covering up another problem, no clue.  This is driving me fing crazy.</p>

"42155","<p>I have a question about throwing exceptions in Java, a kind of misunderstanding from my side, as it seems, which I would like to clarify for myself.</p>

<p>I have been reading that the two basic ways of handling exception code are:</p>

<p>1.) throwing an exception in a try-block with ""throw new ..."", and catching it immediately in a catch-block - the so called try-throw-catch mechanism.</p>

<p>2.) throwing an exception in a method with ""throw new ..."" and then declaring in the header of the method that this method might throw an exception with ""throws ..."" - the so called pass-the-buck.</p>

<p>I have recently read that ""it doesn't make any sense to throw an exception and then catch it in the same method"", which made me think whether I understand the thing in the wrong way, or the person who had written this had something else in mind. Doesn't the first way of handling exceptions does exactly this (the try-throw-catch mechanism) ? I mean, it throws an exception and catches it in the same method. I have read that it is a better practice to throw an exception in one method, and catch it in another method, but this is just one (probably better) way. The other way is also legal and correct, isn't it? </p>

<p>Would you, please, give me a comment on this ? Thank you very much.</p>

"1009","<p>I'm developing an application where I the need to invoke a method of a generic class and I don't care about the instances actual type. Something like the following Java code:</p>

<pre><code>public class Item&lt;T&gt;{
  private T item;

  public doSomething(){...}
}

...
public void processItems(Item&lt;?&gt;[] items){
 for(Item&lt;?&gt; item : items)
   item.doSomething();
}
</code></pre>

<p>At the time I was on a hurry, so I solved my problem by defining a interface with the methods I needed to invoke and made the generic class implement it.</p>

<pre><code>public interface IItem
{
   void doSomething();
}

public class Item&lt;T&gt; : IItem {
  private T item;

  public void doSomething(){...}
}

...
public void processItems(IItem[] items)
{
 foreach(IItem item in items)
   item.doSomething();
}

<p>This workaround works fine, but I'd like to know what is the correct way to achieve the same behavior.  </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I forgot to refer that the caller of <code>processItems</code> doesn't know the actual types. Actually the idea was that the array passed as argument to <code>processItems</code> could contain intermixed types. Since its not possible to have such an array in .Net, using a non generic base class or interface seems to be the only way.</p>

"39590","<p>I've got a base class which is compatible with XML serialization and a derived class which implements IXmlSerializable.</p>

"828","<p>How would I go about using a negative lookbehind(or any other method) regular expression to ignore strings that contains a specific substring?</p>

<p>I've read two previous stackoverflow questions:<br>
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/367862/java-regexp-for-file-filtering"">java-regexp-for-file-filtering</a><br>
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42990/regex-to-match-against-something-that-is-not-a-specific-substring"">regex-to-match-against-something-that-is-not-a-specific-substring</a><br></p>

<p>They are <em>nearly</em> what I want... my problem is the string doesn't end with what I want to ignore.  If it did this would not be a problem.</p>

<p>I have a feeling this has to do with the fact that lookarounds are zero-width and something is matching on the second pass through the string...
but, I'm none too sure of the internals.</p>

<p>Anyway, if anyone is willing to take the time and explain it I will greatly appreciate it.</p>

<p>Here is an example of an input string that I want to ignore:</p>

<p>192.168.1.10 - - [08/Feb/2009:16:33:54 -0800] ""GET /FOO/BAR/ HTTP/1.1"" 200 2246</p>

<p>Here is an example of an input string that I want to keep for further evaluation:</p>

<p>192.168.1.10 - - [08/Feb/2009:16:33:54 -0800] ""GET /FOO/BAR/content.js HTTP/1.1"" 200 2246</p>

<p>The key for me is that I want to ignore any HTTP GET that is going after a document root default page.</p>

<p>Following is my little test harness and the best RegEx I've come up with so far.</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args){
String inString = ""192.168.1.10 - - [08/Feb/2009:16:33:54 -0800] \""GET /FOO/BAR/ HTTP/1.1\"" 200 2246"";
//String inString = ""192.168.1.10 - - [08/Feb/2009:16:33:54 -0800] \""GET /FOO/BAR/content.js HTTP/1.1\"" 200 2246"";
//String inString = ""192.168.1.10 - - [08/Feb/2009:16:33:54 -0800] \""GET /FOO/BAR/content.js HTTP/""; // This works
//String inString = ""192.168.1.10 - - [08/Feb/2009:16:33:54 -0800] \""GET /FOO/BAR/ HTTP/""; // This works
String inRegEx = ""^.*(?:GET).*$(?&lt;!.?/ HTTP/)"";
try {
  Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(inRegEx);

  Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(inString);

  if (matcher.find()) {
    System.out.printf(""I found the text \""%s\"" starting at "" +
""index %d and ending at index %d.%n"",
matcher.group(), matcher.start(), matcher.end());
  } else {
    System.out.printf(""No match found.%n"");
  }
} catch (PatternSyntaxException pse) {
  System.out.println(""Invalid RegEx: "" + inRegEx);

When the button was not in an <code>UpdatePanel</code>, the click event fired, but now that I put it inside an <code>UpdatePanel</code>, the click event does not fire.</p>

<p>I also have a dropdown which works fine.  I am thinking it has something to do with the fact that the <code>ImageButton</code> does not have an <code>AutoPostBack</code> property.</p>

"
"18097","<p>Once upon a time, a young, naive engineer thought it would be a good idea to separate out some of the functionality for his app into a COM component, written in C#.  Visual studio had all the tools to do that, right?  .NET was practically made for this, right?  HA!  He said, this will be easy.  I'll have decent separation of components, keeping business logic away from the front end, and with COM, I'll be able to use it from anywhere!  He merrily checked the <code>register for COM interop</code> checkbox in the project properties, exposed the classses he wanted, and went on his way.</p>

<p>Oh, the trials such a choice made.  The young engineer now, more experienced, would not now wish this upon anyone.  However, the burden had been placed upon his shoulders, and the burden remained heavy.  He looked to lighten the load.</p>

<p>Along came WiX, a tool for generating Windows Installer files from XML.  This intrigued him - it could replicate, quite simply, most of the code needed for a proper windows installer file simply from a handful of configuration files.  His sights were looking up.</p>

<p>With WiX 2.0, he could generate quite easily the files needed to register a C# COM object.  This involved using the tool tallow.  He'd do something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>tallow -c -nologo MyComExposedLibrary.dll &gt; MyComExposedLibrary.wxs
</code></pre>

<p>which would then be fixed up (at first this was done manually, but eventually I recorded the steps into a small tool set the final directory ref id, component ID, fileID, GUID and codebase).</p>

<p>Then, the ensuing installer would install, and there would be joyous celebration, if the app worked.</p>

<p>Which it did not.</p>

<p>For days the young engineer poured over the differences on his development PC and that of the test install PC.  ""All the registry keys are the same!"" He would exclaim.  ""Everything for MyComExposedLibrary is registerd, I swear!""</p>

<p>Except, it wasn't.</p>

<p>On the dawn of third day, after many a mountain dew, he realized there was one more object that Visual Studio was registering that his installer was not: the MyComExposedLibrary.tlb file.</p>

<p>Visual Studio, apparently, had been registering this file all along, creating additional subkeys in the <code>HKLM\Software\Classes\Interface</code> registry key, and registering the typelib in <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\TypeLib</code>.</p>

<p>Tallow gave no help, complaining that a .tlb wasn't a file it groked.  Nor the WiX 3.0 beta - this seemed to have even more issues getting things working.</p>

<p>I also gave Heat a try.  This generated registry elements and class elements.  I cleaned up heat's output, and then went to compile it, but got a different error: <code>error LGHT0130 : The primary key &lt;uuid here&gt; is duplicated in table 'Registry'</code>.   Problem is, as far as I can tell, that uuid doesn't actually exist in any of my wxs source files.  If I change around the component ref order in my feature element, a different dll component gives that error.  Since I have been unsuccessful at getting a WiX 3.0 version of the project to compile, I haven't been able to confirm whether or not heat gives the right output.</p>

<p>I removed everything from the installer except for one of the assembly that cause this error to appear and tried compiling again.  I got the same same error.  Arrugh!</p>

<p>So, my good fellows, Windows enthusiasts, and WiX users, there falls two questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is a typelib something that WiX can register natively?  If so, how?</li>
<li>If not, what's the proper way of registering a typelib with a windows installer?</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I guess as another part of this, how does Visual Studio determine how to register the typelib?  (Edit: looks the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms221610%28vs.71%29.aspx"">MSDN library article on typelib registration has the names of the keys needed</a>, but I still need to figure out how to get the uuid's.  (This is from <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2006/01/09/510856.aspx"">this blog post on typelib and COM registration by Larry Osterman</a>.) )  Reading a bit more, It may fall to me to register these bits manually, but I hope not...</p>

<p>I evaluated the output from <code>regasm /regfile:MyDll.dll MyDll.dll</code>.  It looks like these are the same keys that wix generates for the dll.  Regasm's other mode, <code>regasm /tlb:&lt;filename&gt;</code> generates and registers the typelib for the assembly, but,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>/regfile[:FileName]  Generate a reg file with the specified name
                       instead of registering the types. This option
                       cannot be used with the /u or /tlb options</p>
</blockquote>

<p>seems the /regfile switch is incompatible with the /tlb switch.  Khaaaaaaaan!</p>

<p><b>Further update:</b> It looks like you don't actually <em>need</em> to include the .tlb file.  <a href=""http://chenhaoyork.wordpress.com/2009/02/15/deploy-customized-arcmap-toolbar-via-wix-2/"">According to this post on wix's typelib element</a>, an MSI can create/register this as part of the setup process.  It all comes down to configuring the WiX document to actually install it by getting the right attributes.</p>

<p>I found out later that you can get the right attributes using heat on the .tlb directly!  See <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/567925/typelib-generation-and-installation-with-wix"">this SO question for more information</a>.</p>

<p>Because this file's automatically generated, I've never paid it much heed before, and in VS 2003 (which I still work with day to day - pity me) it never seems to matter if it's missing.</p>

<p>So 2 questions:
1. How can I get VS 2005 to regenerate the file.
2. Could anyone explain to me in a couple of sentences what the assembly info file is all about, why it's generated, why it's a good idea to have an automatically generated file critical to my solution building etc etc.</p>

<p>Thanks - Andrew.</p>

<p>Edit: OK, I've googling some more, and it's probably significant that this is in an Nunit Test Project.</p>

<p>Update: Deleting the reference in solution explorer an Alex suggested did the trick, and the project now builds, but I'm not entirely happy with that as a solution. If the file is so unimportant, why is it generated in the first place? And if the file does perform a vital task, what am I missing out on by just deleting it?</p>

<p>Also, is it even possible to get it back? Either by getting VS to regenerate it, or by manually hacking one up (possibly using another as a template)?</p>

<p><strong>What is caching and what are the different types?</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Is there a distinction between how caching works in your applications vs your database caching?</strong></p>

  piece of code that would hurt caching
  and after they fixed it, it improved
  the speed of their app, what are they
  talking about?</p>

  <p>Is the program's caching something
  that is done automatically?  How do
  you allow values to be cached in your
  programs?  I've often read users on
  this site say that they cached a value
  in their application, I sit here and
  wonder what they mean.</p>

  <p>Also, what does it really mean when
  someone talks about database
  caching?  Is this simply a feature
  they turn on in their database?  Do
  you have to explicitly cache values or
  does the database  pick which ones to
  cache for you?</p>

  <p>Can you give me some examples of how I can begin caching values in my <strong>applications</strong>?  Or again, is this something that is already done, under the hood and I simply have to write my code in a particular way to allow ""caching""?</p>

"37196","<p>I work in an office which has been doing Agile for a while now. We use Scrum for project management and mix in the engineering practices of XP. It works well and we are constantly learning lessons and refining our process.</p>

<p>I would like to tell you about our usual practices for testing and get feedback on how this could be improved:</p>

<p><strong>TDD: First Line of Defense</strong>
We are quite religious about unit testing and I would say our developers are also experienced enough to write comprehensive tests and always isolate the SUT with mocks.</p>

<p><strong>Integration Tests</strong>
For our use, integration tests are basically the same as the unit tests just without using the mocks. This tends to catch a few issues which slipped through the unit tests. These tests tend to be difficult to read as they usually involve a lot or work in the <code>before_each</code> and <code>after_each</code> sections of the spec framework as the system has to often reach a certain state in order for the tests to be meaningful.</p>

<p><strong>Functional Testing</strong>
We usually do this in a structured, but manual fashion. We have played with Selenium and Windmill, which are cool, but for us at least not quite there yet.</p>

<p>I would like to hear how anyone else is doing things. Do you think that if Integration Tests or Functional Testing are being done well enough the other can be disregarded?</p>

"47493","<p>I'm a freshman in college going for my computer science degree... I've programmed plenty the last several years but just lately I've been getting more into theoretical ideas about organizing code, design patterns, differences in languages, etc.</p>

<p>I have a Java class, so I've dropped my C++ research/development and moved into Java and JOGL (Java OpenGL). It's wonderful! But that's beside the point.</p>

<p>I want to make a small role-playing game, but this question really applies to any sort of game. How do you organize the game objects in a way that is structured, like the Model-View-Controller pattern? It looks to be an amazing pattern, very widely used and makes a lot of sense, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to implement it.</p>

<p>For instance, I need to keep track of a GL object for drawing to the screen. I have to have classes that implement MouseListener, MouseMotionListener, MouseWheelListener, and KeyListener (or one class, an all-in-one input manager). And I have to put my game data somewhere where all these different classes can access and modify it; if someone presses a button on the keyboard, the input managing class needs to somehow perform the action that the key is mapped to; when a frame needs to be drawn, the graphics class needs to find a way to loop through all the different 'things' and draw them all.</p>

<p>And my biggest issue, the GUI; where does it tie into it all? It's something like the input, but not quite, and it needs to both set and get pieces of data from the actual game simulation... And complicating it even MORE is if I decide to try and add networking, which (similar to the GUI) also needs to have access to a lot of the data for modifying and reading...</p>

<p>Oh, I'm just all confused. I don't know how to make all this work together in an object-oriented fashion... It's easy enough writing things that clearly fit the patterns, but when you have tons of things happening all tied to one game loop, modifying each other and the game data and so on, ... I don't even know any more. Maybe I'm just making this a bigger deal than it actually is.</p>

<p>Has anyone else felt this way? Please offer some clarity to my situation so I can spend less time worrying and not knowing where to start!</p>

<p>During the downtime we tried restarting everything from the server RS runs on, to the database it calls to fill reports with no success. When I came in monday morning it was working again. </p>

<p>Anyone out there have any ideas on what could be causing these issues?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Tried both suggestions below several months ago to no avail. This issue hasn't arisen since, maybe something out of my control has changed....</p>

"30946","<p>The first real software company that I worked at was all about the unit testing (NUnit). I don't know that we were real sticklers for it back then -- I have no idea what our code coverage was like and I was writing most of the unit tests. Since then I've run into some companies that do lots of testing, but it's chair testing: relies on a person being there, has low repeatibility and low chance of catching bugs. The other attitude is: it was something they wanted to get going with ""in the future""; basically when money falls from the sky.  </p>

<p>I miss unit testing -- it just makes life easier. But I'm finding that when I look for a new job, unit testing is either something that companies would like to ""get going with"" in the future or something they don't do at all (uhh, it's been around for a while now!). I'd say that 60-75% of the job reqs I've looked at over the past 2 years have not listed unit testing at all. I can only think of one or two that had unit testing experience as a requirement (for a mid-level developer position).</p>

<p>So the question is, <strong>what's missing</strong>? I think it makes people more productive, but that's only after spending a solid amount of time actually doing it. Aren't there any good studies about the cost savings of unit testing? Is it the type of company I'm looking at? </p>

<p>Edit: even though the title is a bit devils-advocate, I consider myself a unit testing proponent. </p>

"51649","<p>I have a shell script that saves the output of a command that is executed to a CSV file. It reads the command it has to execute from a shell script which is in this format:</p>

"67468","<p>I'm trying to build some code for dynamically sorting a Linq IQueryable&lt;>.</p>

<p>The obvious way is here, which sorts a list using a string for the field name<br>
<a href=""http://dvanderboom.wordpress.com/2008/12/19/dynamically-composing-linq-orderby-clauses/"">http://dvanderboom.wordpress.com/2008/12/19/dynamically-composing-linq-orderby-clauses/</a></p>

<p>However I want one change - compile time checking of field names, and the ability to use refactoring/Find All References to support later maintenance. That means I want to define the fields as f=>f.Name, instead of as strings.</p>

<p>For my specific use I want to encapsulate some code that would decide which of a list of named ""OrderBy"" expressions should be used based on user input, without writing different code every time.</p>

<p>Here is the gist of what I've written:</p>

<pre><code>var list = from m Movies select m; // Get our list

var sorter = list.GetSorter(...); // Pass in some global user settings object

sorter.AddSort(""NAME"", m=&gt;m.Name);
sorter.AddSort(""YEAR"", m=&gt;m.Year).ThenBy(m=&gt;m.Year);

list = sorter.GetSortedList();

...
public class Sorter&lt;TSource&gt;
...
public static Sorter&lt;TSource&gt; GetSorter(this IQueryable&lt;TSource&gt; source, ...)
</code></pre>

<p>The GetSortedList function determines which of the named sorts to use, which results in a List object, where each FieldData contains the MethodInfo and Type values of the fields passed in AddSort:</p>

<pre><code>public SorterItem&lt;TSource&gt; AddSort(Func&lt;T, TKey&gt; field)
{
   MethodInfo ... = field.Method;
   Type ... = TypeOf(TKey);
   // Create item, add item to diction, add fields to item's List&lt;&gt;
   // The item has the ThenBy method, which just adds another field to the List&lt;&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure if there is a way to store the entire field object in a way that would allow it be returned later (it would be impossible to cast, since it is a generic type)</p>

<p>Is there a way I could adapt the sample code, or come up with entirely new code, in order to sort using strongly typed field names <i>after</i> they have been stored in some container and retrieved (losing any generic type casting)</p>

"15809","<p>A typical problem in OO programming is the diamond problem. I have parent class A with two sub-classes B and C. A has an abstract method, B and C implement it. Now I have a sub-class D, that inherits of B <strong>and</strong> C. The diamond problem is now, what implementation shall D use, the one of B or the one of C?</p>

<p>People claim Java knows no diamond problem. I can only have multiple inheritance with interfaces and since they have no implementation, I have no diamond problem. Is this really true? I don't think so. <strong>See below:</strong></p>

<p>[removed vehicle example]</p>

<p>Is a diamond problem always the cause of bad class design and something neither programmer nor compiler needs to solve, because it shouldn't exist in the first place?</p>

<p>Of course you can make Person virtual in C++ and thus you will only have one instance of person in memory, but the real problem persists IMHO. How would you implement getDepartment() for GradTeachingFellow? Consider, he might be student in one department and teach in another one. So you can either return one department or the other one; there is no perfect solution to the problem and the fact that no implementation might be inherited (e.g. Student and Teacher could both be interfaces) doesn't seem to solve the problem to me.</p>

"","<p>I have a table I'm using as a work queue.  Essentially, it consists of a primary key, a piece of data, and a status flag (processed/unprocessed).  I have multiple processes trying to grab the next unprocessed row, so I need to make sure that they observe proper lock and update semantics to avoid race condition nastiness.  To that end, I've defined a stored procedure they can call:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE get_from_q
AS
DECLARE @queueid INT;
BEGIN TRANSACTION TRAN1;

SELECT TOP 1
    @queueid = id
FROM
    MSG_Q WITH (updlock, readpast)
WHERE
    MSG_Q.status=0;

SELECT TOP 1 *
FROM
    MSG_Q
WHERE
    MSG_Q.id=@queueid;

UPDATE MSG_Q
SET status=1
WHERE id=@queueid;

COMMIT TRANSACTION TRAN1;
</code></pre>

<p>Note the use of ""WITH (updlock, readpast)"" to make sure that I lock the target row and ignore rows that are similarly locked already.</p>

<p>Now, the procedure works as listed above, which is great.  While I was putting this together, however, I found that if the second SELECT and the UPDATE are reversed in order (i.e. UPDATE first then SELECT), I got no data back at all.  And no, it didn't matter whether the second SELECT was before or after the final COMMIT.</p>

<p>My question is thus why the order of the second SELECT and UPDATE makes a difference.  I suspect that there is something subtle going on there that I don't understand, and I'm worried that it's going to bite me later on.</p>

"49942","<p>How should CSS 'margin' and 'padding' be used for vertical inter-paragraph spacing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can the vertical space between paragraphs be defined using padding and/or using margins?</li>
<li>If it can be done with either, then which is the better or more normal one to use?</li>
<li>Do you tend to define non-zero padding <em>and</em> non-zero margins, and if so then how much of each?</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html#mpb-examples"" rel=""nofollow"">Example of margins, padding, and borders</a> explains <em>in theory</em> what the difference is between margin and padding: I'm questioning how much of each to use <em>in practice</em>, to render a normal, good-looking page.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Secondly, given markup like the following ...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List item.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another list item.
&lt;p&gt;List paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you want equal vertical space between each paragraph and/or list item, then:</p>

<ul>
<li>Would you tend to define the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> as having zero margin+padding of its own?</li>
<li>Or would the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> normally have non-zero margin, which would then have no effect because this margin will be collapsed with the margin of the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> within it and of the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> which precedes it?</li>
</ul>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Thirdly (and I'm not sure whether I ought to ask this third question), the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html#collapsing-margins"" rel=""nofollow"">specification for collapsing margins</a> says, ""If the top and bottom margins of a box are adjoining, then it is possible for margins to collapse through it."" If I have an empty paragraph like the following one in the middle ...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>... then I'd expect to see this as an empty paragraph, i.e. with an extra amount of vertical space between the <code>Hello</code> and the <code>World</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>What would prevent this empty paragraph's margins from collapsing, and the empty paragraph therefore being invisible: is it non-zero padding which does this?</li>
<li>In what scenario <strong>is</strong> it useful for a box to have adjoining top and bottom margins which collapse?</li>
</ul>

"70156","<p>I am chipping away at building a client for a Java B2B web-service at the moment and I think I have identified the cause of a problem we have been having for quite some time. Unfortunately I'm unable to post the WSDL.</p>

<p>Apparently my auto-generated proxy code (via wsdl.exe: have to use WSE 3.0 due to WCF not supporting password digest) is not able to handle the web-service's WSDL having multiple web-methods with the same complex return type.</p>

<p>Take for example - a web-service that defines the following methods:</p>

<pre><code>Public ComplexTypeX Blah();
Public ComplexTypeX Blue();
Public ComplexTypeX Foo();
Public ComplexTypeY Bar();
</code></pre>

<p>In my Reference.cs file, if I comment out all code that calls any two of Blah(), Blue() or Foo(), then the remaining uncommented method can be called no problem. However, if I have more than one of these three methods not commented out (say, Blah() and Foo()), then I get the following error message upon <em>instantiation</em> of the web-service client code:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Method Blah can not be reflected.""
  ""The XML element 'ComplexTypeX' from
  namespace '<a href=""http://some.url"" rel=""nofollow"">http://some.url</a>' references
  a method and a type. Change the
  method's message name using
  WebMethodAttribute or change the
  type's root element using the
  XmlRootAttribute.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, there is definitely no <code>ComplexTypeX</code> method defined as part of the web-service, so I can only assume that .NET (or at least wsdl.exe) does not allow you to use a web-service that returns complex (user-defined) types of the same type across multiple methods ... right?</p>

"35657","<p>I need to add timezone information to a db table with user maintained locations. The data will be accessed mostly from Java code but there is also some PL/SQL and Win32 (Delphi) code which needs to understand the timezone information.</p>

<p>It seems straight forward to use the id from java.util.TimeZone. Java can easily convert that (obviously), Hibernate has built-in support for it and apparently also Oracle understands those timezone ids: </p>

<pre><code>select TZ_OFFSET('Pacific/Marquesas') from dual.
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is: the timezone ids do not seem to be compatible with the Windows Timezone DB. For example, the java.util.timezone id ""Pacific/Marquesas"" (-09:30) is not in the timezone picklist in Windows. The registry does not contain it at all; see</p>

<pre>\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Time Zones</pre>

<p>Here I can only pick either -09:00 or -10:00. So, if I were to store the timezone like this, how can I get to the actual offset/DST infos in Windows (without Java)? Hopefully this does not require a mapping table which I have to keep up to date whenever it changes. Is there a globally accepted standard which works better than the java timezone id?</p>

<p><b>Update</b></p>

<p>The timezone info is used in combination with DATE columns on the database. Those columns contain local date/time values. If a location can be associated with those values, the location's timezone enables me to convert the date/time value to UTC or any other timezone whenever needed.</p>

<p>I realize that instead of DATE a TIMESTAMP_TZ data type or something similar would be more appropriate. However, this would require a data migration (for which the TZ is required again) and is not supported by the legacy applications which also work on the data (unless a lot of code is changed). The problem is almost the same if I had to convert the values to UTC.</p>

<p>Bottom line is I need to keep the DATE values in local time but I need to know for some of them which TZ that means.</p>

"14621","<p>I have written some code that makes use of an open source library to do some of the heavy lifting. This work was done in linux, with unit tests and cmake to help with porting it to windows. There is a requirement to have it run on both platforms.</p>

<p>I like Linux and I like cmake and I like that I can get visual studios files automatically generated. As it is now, on windows everything will compile and it will link and it will generate the test executables.</p>

<p>However, to get to this point I had to fight with windows for several days, learning all about manifest files and redistributable packages.</p>

<p>As far as my understanding goes:</p>

<p>With VS 2005, Microsoft created Side By Side dlls. The motivation for this is that before, multiple applications would install different versions of the same dll, causing previously installed and working applications to crash (ie ""Dll Hell""). Side by Side dlls fix this, as there is now a ""manifest file"" appended to each executable/dll that specifies which version should be executed.</p>

<p>This is all well and good. Applications should no longer crash mysteriously. However...</p>

<p>Microsoft seems to release a new set of system dlls with every release of Visual Studios. Also, as I mentioned earlier, I am a developer trying to link to a third party library. Often, these things come distributed as a ""precompiled dll"". Now, what happens when a precompiled dll compiled with one version of visual studios is linked to an application using another version of visual studios?</p>

<p>From what I have read on the internet, bad stuff happens. Luckily, I never got that far - I kept running into the ""MSVCR80.dll not found"" problem when running the executable and thus began my foray into this whole manifest issue.</p>

<p>I finally came to the conclusion that the only way to get this to work (besides statically linking everything) is that all third party libraries must be compiled using the same version of Visual Studios - ie don't use precompiled dlls - download the source, build a new dll and use that instead.</p>

<p>Is this in fact true? Did I miss something?</p>

<p>Furthermore, if this seems to be the case, then I can't help but think that Microsoft did this on purpose for nefarious reasons.</p>

<p>Not only does it break all precompiled binaries making it unnecessarily difficult to use precompiled binaries, if you happen to work for a software company that makes use of third party proprietary libraries, then whenever they upgrade to the latest version of visual studios - your company must now do the same thing or the code will no longer run.</p>

<p>As an aside, how does linux avoid this? Although I said I preferred developing on it and I understand the mechanics of linking, I haven't maintained any application long enough to run into this sort of low level shared libraries versioning problem.</p>

<p>Finally, to sum up: Is it possible to use precompiled binaries with this new manifest scheme? If it is, what was my mistake? If it isn't, does Microsoft honestly think this makes application development easier?</p>

<p>Update - A more concise question: <strong>How does Linux avoid the use of Manifest files?</strong></p>

"68231","<p>I'm trying to get a WPF combobox working (inside the WPFToolkit Datagrid), and I'm having trouble getting all the pieces aligned correctly.  I'm using Linq to Entities, and I'm setting the overall datacontext to  the results of a Linq query:</p>

    		   from donationPurposes in entities.DonationPurpose
    		   select new { donations, donationPurposes };
}
</code></pre>

<p>I also have a page property in my code-behind which provides the ItemsSource for the combobox:</p>

<pre><code>
private IEnumerable donationPurposeList;
public IEnumerable DonationPurposeList
{
    get
    {
    	if (donationPurposeList == null)
    	{
    		donationPurposeList = from dp in entities.DonationPurpose
    							  select dp;
    	}
    	return donationPurposeList.ToList();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The XAML for the combobox looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tk:DataGridTemplateColumn Header=""Purpose""&gt;
    &lt;tk:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate&gt;
        &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
            &lt;TextBlock Text=""{Binding Path=donations.DonationPurpose.Description, Mode=TwoWay}"" /&gt;
        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
    &lt;/tk:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate&gt;
    &lt;tk:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellEditingTemplate&gt;
        &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
            &lt;ComboBox Name=""cboDonationPurpose""
                SelectedValue=""{Binding Path=donations.DonationPurposeID, Mode=TwoWay}""
                ItemsSource=""{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type Page},Mode=FindAncestor},Path=DonationPurposeList}""

        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
    &lt;/tk:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellEditingTemplate&gt;
&lt;/tk:DataGridTemplateColumn&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And everything seems to work correctly, i.e., the appropriate values are displayed in the ComboBox, right up to the point where focus leaves the ComboBox.  At that point, the displayed value returns to the original value, not to the newly selected value.  I've tried using SelectedItem instead of SelectedValue, but that ends up with the selected value not showing in the ComboBox.  I'm kinda mystified: it seems like this bit should be working.</p>

<p>Edited 3/2/09: I'm still puzzling over this.  I should note that in my datagrid, any simple data columns (e.g., ""DataGridTextColumn"") update the underlying data source just as you'd expect.  But any update to any of my templated columns (""DataGridTemplateColumn"") or ComboBox columns (""DataGridComboBoxColumn"") don't work: the underlying data source never gets updated.  Surely other folks have tried to use the WPF.Toolkit datagrid and gotten this scenario to work -- but I've looked at all the sample code out there, and I'm doing basically what it says to do (within the constraints of my solution), so I'm scratching my head why this isn't working.</p>

<p>RESULT - AS requested</p>

<p>We are going to conduct the first steps of the interview the same as before. Phone followed by face to face. Instead of bringing them back for a third and final grilling, we are going to bring 3 developers back to sit with all 7 members of the team. We have decided to let the team decide who is then hired.</p>

<p>We have come to this conclusion for a couple of reasons. We believe this will empower the developers by giving them a choice who they are working. The second reason is group dynamic. We think it is really important to have a good group dynamic and it is hard to tell until after you hire a person if they will fit in or not.</p>

<p>So the end result is we are going to go ahead with the pair programming sessions but in a completely different way and for a completely different way than was originally intended.</p>

"59107","<p>So... messing around in JavaScript with an idea that's new to me, having methods of an Object return the Object of which they are methods; this then leads to chainability. My question, then: how can this be useful? I threw this together to test the fundamental workings:</p>

MathChain = function()

"60628","<p>If I want to make a class adaptable, and make it possible to select different algorithms from the outside -- what is the best implementation in C++?</p>

<p>I see mainly two possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use an abstract base class and pass concrete object in</li>
<li>Use a template</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a little example, implemented in the various versions:</p>

<p><strong>Version 1:</strong> Abstract base class</p>

<pre><code>class Brake {
public: virtual void stopCar() = 0;
};

class BrakeWithABS : public Brake {
public: void stopCar() { ... }
};

class Car {
  Brake* _brake;
public:
  Car(Brake* brake) : _brake(brake) { brake-&gt;stopCar(); }
};
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Version 2a:</strong> Template</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;class Brake&gt;
class Car {
  Brake brake;
public:
  Car(){ brake.stopCar(); }
};
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Version 2b:</strong> Template and private inheritance</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;class Brake&gt;
class Car : private Brake {
  using Brake::stopCar;
public:
  Car(){ stopCar(); }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Coming from Java, I am naturally inclined to always use version 1, but the templates versions seem to be preferred often, e.g. in STL code? If that's true, is it just because of memory efficiency etc (no inheritance, no virtual function calls)? </p>

<p>I realize there is not a big difference between version 2a and 2b, see <a href=""http://www.parashift.com/c%2B%2B-faq-lite/private-inheritance.html#faq-24.2"">C++ FAQ</a>.</p>

"","<p>I'm trying to put some (vertically-stacked) display:block elements within a display:inline-block element. According to the CSS specification, the inline-block element should be a containing block, so it can have display:block elements within it and those should not affect the rest of the layout.</p>

<p>However, the display:block elements inside the display:inline-block elements disrupt the rest of the page; so does having nothing at all within the inline-block, or even a basic element like a paragraph; only simple text avoids disruption of the rest of the page (by disruption I mean shifting other divs down, e.g. in this case the left red block moves down a line and has a blank white space above it). I'm using Firefox 3.0.6.</p>

  width: 20%;

}
#right {

  background: green;
  width: 80%;
  height: 100%;

<p>But I cannot figure out how to feed this to grep to give me all the rows.
Obviously, I can't use <code>xargs</code> straight up since the output contains spaces.  I thought I could do <code>uniq -z -d</code> but for some reason, combining those flags causes uniq to (apparently) return nothing. </p>

<p>So, given that</p>

<pre><code> $ cut -d, -f 5 myfile.csv | sort | uniq -d -z | xargs -0 -I {} grep '{}' myfile.csv
</code></pre>

<p>doesn't work... what can I do?</p>

<p>I know that I could do this in <code>perl</code> or another scripting language... but my stubborn nature insists that I should be able to do it in <code>bash</code> using standard commandline tools like <code>sort</code>, <code>uniq</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>cut</code>, etc.</p>

<p>I need to write a simple pink-noise generator in C#. The problem is, I've never done any audio work before, so I don't know how to interact with the sound card, etc. I do know that I want to stay away from using DirectX, mostly because I don't want to download a massive SDK just for this tiny project.</p>

<p>So I have two problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>How do I generate Pink Noise?</li>
<li>How do I stream it to the sound card?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I <em>really</em> want to make a pink noise generator... I'm aware there are other ways to solve the root problem. =)</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: Our firewall blocks streaming audio and video - otherwise I'd just go to <a href=""http://www.simplynoise.com"">www.simplynoise.com</a> as suggested in the comments. :(</p>

<p><strong>Edit 3</strong>: I've got the generation of white-noise down, as well as sending output to the sound card - now all I need to know is how to turn the white-noise into pink noise. Oh - and I don't want to loop a wav file because every application I've tried to use for looping ends up with a tiny little break in between loops, which is jarring enough to have prompted me in this direction in the first place...</p>

<p><strong>Edit 4</strong>: ... I'm surprised so many people have jumped in to very explicitly <em>not</em> answer a question. I probably would have gotten a better response if I lied about why I need pink noise... This question is more about how to generate and stream data to the sound card than it is about what sort of headphones I should be using. To that end I've edited out the background details - you can read about it in the edits...</p>

<p><strong>Edit 5</strong>: I've selected Paul's answer below because the link he provided gave me the formula to convert white noise (which is easily generated via the random number generator) into pink noise. In addition to this, I used <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/audio-video/cswavplayfx.aspx"">Ianier Munoz's CodeProject entry ""Programming Audio Effects in C#""</a> to learn how to generate, modify, and output sound data to the sound card.

"22088","<p>Learning Java, so be gentle please. Ideally I need to create an array of bytes that will point to a portion of a bigger array:</p>

byte[100] sub = big + 200;

<p>I know this is not possible in Java and there are two work-arounds that come to mind and would include:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Either copying portion of <em>big</em> into <em>sub</em> iterating through <em>big</em>.</p></li>

"5309","<p>Is it possible to create macros to replace all forms of <code>operator new</code> with overloads that include additional args...say <code>__FILE__</code> and <code>__LINE__</code>?</p>

<p>The trouble appears to be that <code>operator new</code> can either be coded with or without parentheses, therefore:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>object-like</em> macros:</p>

<pre><code>#define new new(__FILE__, __LINE__)
</code></pre>

<p>will replace declarations like:</p>

<pre><code>A* a = new A();
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>and <em>function-like</em> macros:</p>

<pre><code>#define new(A) new (A, __FILE__, __LINE__)
</code></pre>

<p>will replace declarations like:</p>

<pre><code>A* a = new(std::nothrow) A();
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately it's an error to attempt to declare two macros with the same <em>identifier</em>, even if they are of different <em>types</em>, so the following fails:</p>

<pre><code>#define new new(__FILE__, __LINE__)
#define new(A) new (A, __FILE__, __LINE__) // Error: ""new"" already defined
</code></pre>

<p>Since I'm using g++ I was hopeful that employing their syntax of <a href=""https://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/RHEL-4-Manual/gcc/variadic-macros.html"">variadic macros</a> would yield success, but unfortunately not. The following:</p>

"14690","<p>I have a large amount of data to move using two PHP scripts: one on the client side using a command line PHP script and other behind Apache. I POST the data to the server side and use php://input stream to save it on the web-server end. To prevent from reaching any memory limits, data is separated into 500kB chunks for each POST request. All this works fine. </p>

<p>Now, to save the bandwidth and speed it up, I want to compress the data before sending and decompress when received on the other end. I found 3 pairs of functions that can do the job, but I cannot decide which one to use:</p>

<p><em>The gzip format (<code>gzencode</code>) was designed to retain the directory information about a single file, such as the name and last modification date. The zlib format (<code>gzcompress</code>) on the other hand was designed for in-memory and communication channel applications, and has a much more compact header and trailer and uses a faster integrity check than gzip.</em></p>

"","<p>I'm using <strong>Delphi 2009</strong> not that it has a large affect on what I'm doing. I think I would run into the same if I was still on <strong>2007</strong>.</p>

<p>I have a scsi call that outputs data to a pointer (wrong way of looking at it but i have trouble explaining that).</p>

<p>Originally I used <strong>Move</strong> to populate a <strong>Static Array of Byte</strong> with the data that came back, but I'd like to switch to a <strong>Dynamic Array</strong> to which the length of is known at the time of the call.  I've tried several things with varied results some get the data but have mad access violations others have no errors but get invalid data.</p>

<p>Adding <strong>setlength</strong> to the array and then using <strong>move</strong>, causes first to have an empty array of set length and then second not be able to access the data via like <strong>OutputData[0]</strong> like I did when it was static, in the debugger after the move everything shows as innaccesable value or whatever.</p>

<p>Below is something I tried after reading an article that did the oposit took a dynamic array and gave a pointer that address.  It mentioned making mistakes like orphaning data.</p>

<pre><code>var
  Output: Pointer;
  OutputData: Array of byte;
  I: Integer;
begin
GetMem(Output, OutputLength.Value);
if SendPSPQuery(Char(DriveLetter[1]), cbxQuery.Items.IndexOf(cbxQuery.Text), Output, OutputLength.Value) = 0 then
  begin
    OutputData := @Output;
    for I := 0 to OutputLength.Value - 1 do
    begin
      edtString.Text := edtString.Text + Char(OutputData[I]);
    end;

<p>There is various otherstuff that th eoutput data is used for it gets put out in string and hex and things.</p>

<p>Anyway, how can I Take a Pointer put that data into a dynamic array and then grab that data the way you would address an array.</p>

"76286","<p>I am building up a String out of multiple pieces and want to use either StringBuffer or StringBuilder to do so. From the Java 5 docs, I see that StringBuilder is preferred when possible, with the caveat that ""Instances of StringBuilder are not safe for use by multiple threads"". From this statement I understand that I should not have a single StringBuilder instance shared by multiple threads. But what about this case:</p>

<pre><code>//Is this safe?
//foo() is called simultaneously by multiple threads
String foo(String a, String b) {
    return new StringBuilder(a).append(b).toString();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here there could be multiple threads in the function at the same time, using the StringBuilder class at the same time (eg, concurrent access of static variables, if there are any), but each thread would have its own separate instance of StringBuilder. From the documentation I can not quite decide whether this counts as use by multiple threads or not.</p>

<p>What is the difference between this:</p>

<pre><code>ShellPresenter presenter = new ShellPresenter();
</code></pre>

<p>and this:</p>

<pre><code>ShellPresenter presenter = Container.Resolve&lt;ShellPresenter&gt;();
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>I understand the second example is treating the container like a factory, walking up to it saying ""I need an instantiated object of type ShellPresenter"". </li>
<li>But what if, e.g. I need to send parameters, what would be the equivalent of ""new ShellPresenter(1, true)"" etc.?</li>
<li>And since the Container has to be told about the ShellPresenter, I expected to find somewhere in the project a place where the ShellPresenter class being registered with the container, e.g. I was expecting</li>
</ul>

<p>something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Container.RegisterType&lt;IShellPresenter, ShellPresenter&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>but found it nowhere. So how does the container get to know about these types so it can .Resolve them? <strong>I rebuilt this in its own project and get a ""Resolution of the dependency failed"" error</strong>, where do I need to register this dependency then?</p>

<p>Any direction/discussion here would be helpful.</p>

<h2>Unexplained Answer:</h2>

<p>So, in the bootstrapper, when I register the Shell itself:</p>

<pre><code>protected override void ConfigureContainer()
{
    Container.RegisterType&lt;IShellView, Shell&gt;();
    base.ConfigureContainer();
}
</code></pre>

<p>then the Container can resolve the ShellPresenter type. So how is the <strong>ShellPresenter</strong> type registered when I register the <strong>Shell</strong> type?</p>

<h2>The Surprising Answer:</h2>

<p>Ok, so it turns out that you don't have to register the type you are trying to resolve but <strong>you do have to register the parameter (interface) types passed to the constructor of the type you are trying to resolve</strong>, i.e. since I inject the IShellView interface into my ShellPresenter's constructor, I needed to register the IShellView type and not the IShellPresenter type:</p>

<pre><code>public ShellPresenter(IShellView view) ...
</code></pre>

<p>I tested this by trying to resolve the type <strong>Tester</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>Tester tester = Container.Resolve&lt;Tester&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>As long as I inject <strong>SomeClass</strong> into its constructor:</p>

<pre><code>public Tester(ISomeClass someClass)
</code></pre>

<p>I get unresolved dependency errors until I register <strong>SomeClass</strong> with the container:</p>

<pre><code>Container.RegisterType&lt;ISomeClass, SomeClass&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>Then it works. This is as surprising as it is educational. Needs to sink in. I'm going to go get a coffee and think about this for awhile.</p>

<p><strong>If anyone can elaborate on why this is the case, it would be much appreciated.</strong></p>

It shows assignment of a string to be 100-1000 times slower than <code>char*</code> assignment (it's very difficult to test the run-time of a <code>char*</code> assignment).  I know it's not a fair comparison, a pointer assignment versus string copy, but my program has lots of string assignments and I'm not sure I could use the ""<em>const reference</em>"" trick in all places.  With a reference counting implementation my program would have been fine, but these implementations don't seem to exist anymore.</p>

<p>My real question is:  why don't people use reference counting implementations anymore, and does this mean we all need to be much more careful about avoiding common performance pitfalls of std::string?</p>

<p>My full code is below.  </p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;

using std::cout;

void stop()
{
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    #define LIMIT 100000000
    clock_t start;
    std::string foo1 = ""Hello there buddy"";
    std::string foo2 = ""Hello there buddy, yeah you too"";
    std::string f;
    start = clock();
    for (int i=0; i &lt; LIMIT; i++) {
        stop();
        f = foo1;
        foo1 = foo2;
        foo2 = f;
    }
    double stl = double(clock() - start) / CLOCKS\_PER\_SEC;

    start = clock();
    for (int i=0; i &lt; LIMIT; i++) {
        stop();
    }
    double emptyLoop = double(clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

    char* goo1 = ""Hello there buddy"";
    char* goo2 = ""Hello there buddy, yeah you too"";
    char *g;
    start = clock();
    for (int i=0; i &lt; LIMIT; i++) {
        stop();
        g = goo1;
        goo1 = goo2;
        goo2 = g;
    }
    double charLoop = double(clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Empty loop = "" &lt;&lt; emptyLoop &lt;&lt; ""\n"";
    cout &lt;&lt; ""char* loop = "" &lt;&lt; charLoop &lt;&lt; ""\n"";

<strong>EDIT</strong> (Moved from below -- OP submitted this clarification as an answer)</p>

<p>I guess I should have clarified what I wanted to do. I will start a script from a pty, let's say it's /dev/pts/3. This script will open 3 xterminals, lets say: /dev/pts/0, /dev/pts/1, and /dev/pts/2. These 3 new ptys are what the user is going to see. The script asks the user for some input and I want the input of the user to be typed into /dev/pty/1 and the program should get it's info from there. However I've tried to do this and it doesn't work. Here's a snippet of my code. </p>

<pre><code>exec&lt;/dev/pts/1

echo
echo ""Would you like to search for more info?"" 1&gt;/dev/pts/1

"
"60096","<p>I've come across a design pattern that's been referred to as a ""Handler Pattern,"" but I can't find any real references to this pattern anywhere.  It's basically just a one-method interface that allows you to easily extend the functionality on the back-end without making clients recompile.  Might be useful for a web-service that has to handle many different types of requests.  Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IHandler
{
    IDictionary&lt;string, string&gt; Handle(IDictionary&lt;string, string&gt; args);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The args would typically include one key like ""Action"" with a value that tells the implmentation what to do.  Additional args can be passed in to give the impl more information.  The impl then passes back an arbitrary list of args that the client ""should"" understand.</p>

<p>Is this an anti-pattern, or maybe another pattern in disguise?  Is this type of design recommended?</p>

<p>EDIT:
A little more info:  The way I've seen this implemented, the ""root"" Handler would act as a dispatcher to other concrete handlers (maybe?).  The root handler has a ""HandlerResolver,"" which decides which concrete handler should get the message based on it's contents.  Maybe it's actually like a ""dispatcher"" pattern, although I don't know if that's really a pattern either.  I guess it could also have a chain-of-responsibility pattern in the root, that allows you to chain together a bunch of concrete handlers, then let them decide which one will handle it.</p>

public enum SoundEffect {
   EAT(""eat.wav""),   // explosion
   GONG(""gong.wav""),         // gong
   SHOOT(""shoot.wav"");       // bullet

      MUTE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH
   }

   public static Volume volume = Volume.LOW;

   // Each sound effect has its own clip, loaded with its own sound file.
   private Clip clip;

   // Constructor to construct each element of the enum with its own sound file.
   SoundEffect(String soundFileName) {

         // Use URL (instead of File) to read from disk and JAR.
         URL url = this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResource(soundFileName);
         // Set up an audio input stream piped from the sound file.
         AudioInputStream audioInputStream = AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(url);
         // Get a clip resource.
         clip = AudioSystem.getClip();
         // Open audio clip and load samples from the audio input stream.
         clip.open(audioInputStream);
      } catch (UnsupportedAudioFileException e) {

<p>Here is an implementation of the EAT sound in my game's Reward class-</p>

<pre><code>public void react(CollisionEvent e)

        Player player = game.getPlayer();
        if (e.contact.involves(player)) {
            player.changePlayerImageEAT();
            SoundEffect.EAT.play();
            player.addPoint();
            System.out.println(""Player now has: ""+player.getPoints()+ "" points."");
            game.getCurrentLevel().getWorld().remove(this);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This should play the EAT sound when player comes in contact with a reward in my game.</p>

<p>However, when my player collides with a reward, I get the following errors in the terminal-</p>

<p>I can't figure out what wrong. I'm guessing it has something to do with my audio files (WAV) being unsupported. However, no matter how many ways I convert them they still don't work.</p>

<p>It would be really helpful if someone can kindly enlighten me on what might be wrong and how I can resolve this.</p>

<p>Sample code and any modifications you can offer to help make this code work will be greatly appreciated.</p>

"5542","<p>Are there any non-blocking IO frameworks for .NET? </p>

<p>I am looking for something similar to what <a href=""http://mina.apache.org/"">Apache Mina</a> and <a href=""http://www.jboss.org/netty"">JBoss Netty</a> provides for Java: a framework for implementing highly scalable servers - not just the low-level support that the .NET framework provides.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> To better explain what I would like to see, here is a basic example of what you can do with Mina:</p>

<p>In Mina I can implement a ProtocolDecoder like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class SimpleDecoder extends CumulativeProtocolDecoder {
  protected boolean doDecode(IoSession session, IoBuffer in, ProtocolDecoderOutput out) throws Exception {
    if (in.remaining() &lt; 4)
      return false;
    int length = in.getInt();
    if(in.remaining() &lt; 4 + length)
      return false;
    Command command = new Command(in.asInputStream());
    out.write(command);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And a CommandHandler like this:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class CommandHandler extends IoHandlerAdapter{
  public void messageReceived(IoSession session, Object message) throws IOException, CloneNotSupportedException {
    Command command = (Command) message;
    // Handle command. Probably by putting it in a workqueue.
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I start the server by calling</p>

<pre><code>CommandHandler handler = new CommandHandler();
NioSocketAcceptor acceptor = new NioSocketAcceptor();
acceptor.getFilterChain().addLast(""protocol"", new ProtocolCodecFilter(new SimpleDecoder(false)));
acceptor.setLocalAddress(new InetSocketAddress(port));
acceptor.setHandler(handler);
acceptor.bind();
</code></pre>

<p>I will get a non-blocking server.</p>

<p>It will run a single (or at least just a few) threads, cycling through all incoming connections, gathering data from the sockets, and call <code>SimpleDecoder.doDecode()</code> to see if it has a complete command on the connection. Then it will pass the command to <code>CommandHandler.messageReceived()</code>, and I can take over the processing.</p>
"
"51211","<p>In application frameworks I keep seeing frameworks that allow you to pass in multiple Int values (generally used in place of an enum) into a function. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>public class Example
{
    public class Values
    {
        public static final int ONE = 0x7f020000;
        public static final int TWO = 0x7f020001;
        public static final int THREE = 0x7f020002;
        public static final int FOUR = 0x7f020003;
        public static final int FIVE = 0x7f020004;
    }

    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
    	// should evaluate just Values.ONE
    	Example.multiValueExample(Values.ONE);

    	// should evalueate just values Values.ONE,  Values.THREE, Values.FIVE
    	Example.multiValueExample(Values.ONE | Values.THREE | Values.FIVE);

    	// should evalueate just values Values.TWO , Values.FIVE
    	Example.multiValueExample(Values.TWO | Values.FIVE);
    }

    public static void multiValueExample(int values){
    	// Logic that properly evaluates bitwise values
    	...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So what logic should exist in multiValueExample for me to properly evaluate multiple int values being passed in using the bitwise operator? </p>

"7595","<p>I'm writing a spec for my Rails controller, this is the action I'm testing:</p>

    redirect_to courses_path
  else
    render :action =&gt; 'new', :status =&gt; 400

<p><strong>FAILED</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>expected redirect to ""/courses"", got
  no redirect</p>

<p>Any ideas why this happens?</p>

<p><strong>SOLVED</strong></p>

<p>as <strong>rishavrastogi</strong> stated, *should be_success* expects a http code on the 2xx range, and a redirect falls into the 3xx range (actually its 302)</p>

<p>The assertion needs to be changed to => *response.should be_redirect*.</p>

<p>Although in this case, it's redundant to check that the response is a redirect and then checking that redirects to an specific page, so that assertion is not needed anymore.</p>

"","<p>I'm trying to complete a project for school involving the use of semaphores. I have included the proper header files ( plus one for pthreads). I have pointed the compiler to the proper libraries as well. This is written in C. Yes, this is an assignment, but please be aware I am not looking for help with implementation, rather I can't seem to figure out this damnable compile error. </p>

<p>Here are lines 47 through 50 of my code, which are ""simple"" declarations of the semaphores and initializing them: </p>

<pre><code>sem_t empty;
sem_init(&amp;empty, 0, 5);
sem_t full;
sem_init(&amp;full, 0, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the messages I'm getting when I try and compile for line 48. I get the same set for line 50 but didn't post it for the sake of brevity: </p>

<pre><code>|48|error: expected declaration specifiers or ‘...’ before ‘&amp;’ token|
|48|error: expected declaration specifiers or ‘...’ before numeric constant|

|48|warning: data definition has no type or storage class|
|48|warning: type defaults to ‘int’ in declaration of ‘sem_init’|

<p>I have declared all these outside the main() function. How can I resolve these errors? I'm baffled because it seems to indicate no data type for sem_t, but it is defined in semaphore.h, which I have included. I am compiling this using Code::Blocks under Ubuntu, which is using gcc.  This error occurs even when compiling from the command line.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for the help. </p>

"46799","<p>I've never used distributed caches/DHTs like memcached, jboss cache, ehcache, etc.  I'm wondering which, if any, is appropriate for my use.</p>

<p>First, I'm not doing web applications (as most of these project seem to be geared towards web apps).  I write servers (Order Management Systems actually) for financial trading firms.  The servers themselves are not too complicated.  They need to receive information (market data, orders, executions, etc.) rout them to their destination while possibly transforming some of these messages.</p>

<p>I am looking at these products to solve the following problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Safe repository of the state of the server.  I'd rather build the logic of my application as a bunch of transformers (similar to Apache Camel) and store the state in a 'safe' place</p></li>
<li><p>This repository should be distributed: in case one of these data stores crashes, one or two more should be up and I should be able to switch to them seamlessly</p></li>
<li><p>This repository should be <em>fast</em>.  Single digits milliseconds count here, in other words, systems which consume/process this data are automated systems, not humans clicking on links.  This system needs to have high-throughput <em>and</em> low latency.  By sending my data outside the process, I am necessarily slowing performance, but I am trying to balance absolute raw speed and absolute protection of data.</p></li>
<li><p>This repository should be safe.  Similar to the point about several on-line backups, this system needs to write data to disk (potentially more than one disk).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'd really like to stop writing my own 'transaction servers.'  Am I correct to be looking into projects such as jboss cache, ehcache, etc.?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

"2680373","<p>If I have two colors defined by their RGB values, can I average the Red, Green and Blue values and then combine to define a third color that looks like a visual average of the two?</p>

<p>EDIT1: Thanks for all the responses.  For my current needs, I am only dealing with color pairs that are shades of the same color so I think that averaging them will work.  However, I will try converting to Lab Space to make sure that assumption is true and the technique will be useful in the future.</p>

<p>EDIT2: Here are my results FWIW.  Color1 and Color2 are my two colors and the two middle columns are the results of averaging in L<em>a</em>b space and averaging RGB respectively.  In this case there is not a lot of difference between the two color and so the differences in the output from the averaging techniques is subtle.</p>

"15904","<p>I'm new to interfaces and abstract classes. I want to create a couple of interfaces to define core methods and variables for the objects for a shopping cart system. Then I want to create abstract classes which implement the core functions. The idea is that they can be used by other classes in slightly different ways for different projects.</p>

<p>Here are my (cut-down) interfaces:</p>

<pre><code>public interface ICart
{
    ...
    List&lt;ICartItem&gt; CartItems { get; set; }
}

public interface ICartItem
{
    int ProductId { get; set; }
    int Quantity { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here is my abstract Cart class (again, only showing relevant lines) which implements ICart:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Cart : ICart
{

    private List&lt;CartItem&gt; _cartItems = new List&lt;CartItem&gt;();

    public List&lt;CartItem&gt; CartItems
    {
        get
        {
            return _cartItems;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And my CartItem class which implements ICartItem:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class CartItem : ICartItem
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I try to compile the classes I get an error saying: 'Cart' does not implement interface member 'CartItems'. 'Cart.CartItems' cannot implement 'ICart.CartItems' because it does not have the matching return type of System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;ICartItem&gt;.</p>

<p>I thought that the idea here is that the interface can be implemented by a number of classes which perform the core functions in different ways and add new methods, etc. Why would my interface need to know what class is actually being used, just as long as that class actually implements the interface correctly? </p>

<p>Any help appreciated!</p>

"62993","<p>I wrote a small Python application that runs as a daemon. It utilizes threading and queues. </p>

<p>I'm looking for general approaches to altering this application so that I can communicate with it while it's running. Mostly I'd like to be able to monitor its health.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, I'd like to be able to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>python application.py start  # launches the daemon
</code></pre>

<p>Later, I'd like to be able to come along and do something like:</p>

<pre><code>python application.py check_queue_size  # return info from the daemonized process
</code></pre>

<p>To be clear, I don't have any problem implementing the Django-inspired syntax. What I don't have any idea how to do is to send signals to the daemonized process (start), or how to write the daemon to handle and respond to such signals.</p>

<p>Like I said above, I'm looking for general approaches. The only one I can see right now is telling the daemon constantly log everything that might be needed to a file, but I hope there's a less messy way to go about it.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Wow, a lot of great answers. Thanks so much. I think I'll look at both Pyro and the web.py/Werkzeug approaches, since Twisted is a little more than I want to bite off at this point. The next conceptual challenge, I suppose, is how to go about talking to my worker threads without hanging them up.</p>

<p>Thanks again.</p>

"14964","<p>The g++ compiler complains with this error when I declare a friend thusly:</p>

<p>Why should the <strong>class</strong> keyword be required?
(the Borland C++ compiler, BTW, does not require it.)</p>

<p>Couldn't the compiler simply look-up MyClass in the symbol table and tell it was declared as a class? (it is obviously doing the look-up anyway because it complains when MyClass it not declared)</p>

<p>It is not like it is making a forward declaration of the class: I still have to have either declared the class above or at least have forward declared it.</p>

<p>There are a plethora of ways to access SQL Server and other databases from .NET. All have their pros and cons and it will never be a simple question of which is ""best"" - the answer will always be ""it depends"".</p>

<p>However, I am looking for <strong>a comparison at a high level of the different approaches and frameworks in the context of different levels of systems</strong>. For example, I would imagine that for a quick-and-dirty Web 2.0 application the answer would be very different from an in-house Enterprise-level CRUD application.</p>

<p>I am aware that there are numerous questions on Stack Overflow dealing with subsets of this question, but I think it would be useful to try to build a summary comparison. I will endeavour to update the question with corrections and clarifications as we go.</p>

I am primarily focusing on the Microsoft approaches to keep this focused.</p>

<h2><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADO.NET_Entity_Framework"">ADO.NET Entity Framework</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Database agnostic</li>
<li>Good because it allows swapping backends in and out</li>
<li>Bad because it can hit performance and database vendors are not too happy about it</li>
<li>Seems to be MS's preferred route for the future</li>
<li>Complicated to learn (though, see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/267357/how-is-the-net-entity-framework-overkill-versus-linqtosql"">267357</a>)</li>
<li>It is accessed through <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADO.NET_Entity_Framework#LINQ_to_Entities"">LINQ to Entities</a> so provides ORM, thus allowing abstraction in your code</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query#LINQ_to_SQL"">LINQ to SQL</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Uncertain future (see <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/11/DLINQ-Future"">Is LINQ to SQL truly dead?</a>)</li>
<li>Easy to learn (?)</li>

<li>See also <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/271384/pros-and-cons-of-linq-language-integrated-query"">Pros and cons of LINQ</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>""Standard"" ADO.NET</h2>

<ul>
<li>No ORM</li>
<li>No abstraction so you are back to ""roll your own"" and play with dynamically generated SQL</li>
<li>Direct access, allows potentially better performance</li>
<li>This ties in to the age-old debate of whether to focus on objects or relational data, to which the answer of course is ""it depends on where the bulk of the work is"" and since that is an unanswerable question hopefully we don't have to go in to that too much. IMHO, if your application is primarily manipulating large amounts of data, it does not make sense to abstract it too much into objects in the front-end code, you are better off using stored procedures and dynamic SQL to do as much of the work as possible on the back-end. Whereas, if you primarily have user interaction which causes database interaction at the level of tens or hundreds of rows then ORM makes complete sense. So, I guess my argument for good old-fashioned ADO.NET would be in the case where you manipulate and modify large datasets, in which case you will benefit from the direct access to the backend.</li>
<li>Another case, of course, is where you have to access a legacy database that is already guarded by stored procedures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>ASP.NET Data Source Controls</h2>

<p>Are these something altogether different or just a layer over standard ADO.NET?
- Would you really use these if you had a DAL or if you implemented LINQ or Entities?</p>

<h2>NHibernate</h2>

<li>Seems to be a very powerful and powerful ORM?</li>
<li>Open source</li>

"","<p>I'm having a strange problem, basically in Java Graphics.drawImage() is extremely slow on some computers and faster on others. This isn't related to the computers power either, some weaker computers run it fine while some stronger ones seem to choke up at the drawImage call.</p>

<p>It may or may not be related to the width and height, I have a very, very large width and height defined (something like 5000 by 2500). I wouldn't think it's the issue except like I said it runs in real time speed on some computers and slower on others and doesn't seem to be tied to the computers relative power.</p>

<p>Both computers have the same version of Java, both use Vista. One has a 1.83ghz Core 2 Duo with 1gb RAM and onboard graphics (runs everything fine), the other has a 2.53 ghz core 2 duo with a 9600GS (latest nVidia drivers) and 4gb of RAM and it literally chugs on the drawImage call.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>edit: ok this is really wierd, I'm drawing the image to a window in Swing, now when I resize the window and make it really small the image gets scaled down too and it becomes small. Suddenly everything runs smoothly, when I scale it back up to the size it was before it's still running smoothly!</p>

<p>It also has multiple monitor issues, if I do the resize trick to make it run faster on one monitor then scroll it over to another monitor when more than half of the window is in the new monitor it starts chugging again. I have to resize the window again to small then back to its original size to get back the speed.</p>

<p>If I do the resize trick on one monitor, move it over to the other it of course chugs, but if I return it back to the original monitor on which I did the resize trick it works 100%</p>

<p>If I have two swing windows open (displaying the same image) they both run slow, but if I do the resize trick on one window they both start running smoothly (however this isn't always the case).</p>

<p>*when I say resize the window I mean make it as small as possible to the point the image can't actually be seen.</p>

<p>Could this be a bug in Java maybe?</p>

"16631","<p><strong>Update:</strong>  <em>I got the first part working, but the corners are not.  See part 2 below.</em></p>

<p>How do you apply a style to a tabBar (in GWT) so that you can a single tabBar at a time?  I have a few different tabPanels that need to have different styles but I can't figure out how to correctly apply the style to the bar and then how to add that style to my CSS.</p>

<p>When I do something like:</p>

<pre><code>tabBar.addstyle(""thisisastyle"");
</code></pre>

<p>It adds the style for the whole bar, I want to apply it to a set of items, specifically changing the background colors for individual tabs.  I am using a DecoratedTabPanel and I have my own set of images for rounded corners and such that I would like to use.  Also, once the style is correctly applied, how do I call it in the CSS?  My current attempt is like so:</p>

<pre><code>.topTabs .gwt-DecoratedTabBar .tabMiddleCenter {
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Part 2</strong></p>

<p>All the other CSS styles are easily applied after setting a style name to the tab bar and addressing them as follows:</p>

<pre><code>.customizedStyleName .tabTopCenter {
    background-image: url('images/centerTopImage.gif');
}
</code></pre>

<p>but this doesn't appear to work for the two corners, the base GWT overrides my CSS.  The CSS for the right corner looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>html &gt; body .gwt-DecoratedTabBar .tabTopRight {
</code></pre>

  <p>Er.... why? Seriously, why break standards? – Randolpho</p>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I suggest, then, that you investigate building a web service. WCF is a nice technology for that, and it hosts well in IIS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I happen to like urls, and WCF is way too complicated for my purposes. I want it to be url-compatible, like REST, but capable of more than just navigating hierarchies, or doing well laid-out things. The problem I have with /users/chaiguy is that it is interpreting hierarchy where there is none: in my system ""user"" is a class, it's not a folder. user:chaiguy means the instance of the user class with the value of ""chaiguy"", and that is a single entity, that has the potential of having child-entities. So for example:</p>

<p><code>/user:chaiguy/name</code></p>

<p>...I would like to display the name of that entity. If I did this with your method, it would look like this:</p>

<p><code>/users/chaiguy/name</code></p>

<p>The problem is how do you know what's the class and what's the value? It could be interpreted as</p>

<p><code>/users/chaiguy:name</code></p>

<p>in my system, and that doesn't make sense. See what I'm getting at? To give a slightly more complicated example, suppose we want to select a child of the user entity out of multiple instances. So a user might have several email addresses. To select one, we might use:</p>

<p><code>/user:chaiguy/email:me@here.com/</code></p>

<p>So it is in fact recursive. It's not a file path, it's more like an XPath (or maybe similar to jQuery based on what little I know of it yet). That is, it's more of a dynamically-evaluated query selection than a hardwired file path. It gets evaluated on the server.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, I'm not building a typical web site or even web service here.</p>

"","<p>In ASP.net MVC:</p>

<p>How should/Can I pass Form data (From the View) to the Controller? </p>

<p>This is the way I am heading :</p>

<ul>
<li>The Controller Index function is passing a ViewModel object to the View. </li>
<li>The ViewModel object contains a paginated list as well as some SelectLists.
_ The ViewModel object also contains a custom class I named theFilter. This class' purpose is to hold the Filter information Posted from the View via a Form.</li>
<li>I want the  Index [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)] function to receive theFilter object populated with the form data, as well as the page number (as is it right now)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are snippets of my code:</p>

<p>The Controller/Index postback function:</p>

<pre><code>    [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]
    public ActionResult Index(int? page, CaseFilter caseFilter)
    {
        const int pageSize = 10;
        var cases = caseRepo.FindAllCases();
        var paginatedCases = new PaginatedList&lt;Case&gt;(cases, page ?? 0, pageSize);
        return View(new CaseIndexViewModel(paginatedCases, caseFilter));
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The Filter Class:</p>

<pre><code>public class CaseFilter
{
    int iVolume_id = 0,
        iSubject_id = 0;

    public CaseFilter() {

    }

    public int Volume_id { get { return iVolume_id; } set { iVolume_id = value; } }
    public int Subject_id { get { return iSubject_id; } set { iSubject_id = value; } }

}
</code></pre>

<p>And the ViewModel class:</p>

<pre><code>    public class CaseIndexViewModel
    {
    public PaginatedList&lt;Case&gt; PaginatedCases { get; private set; }
    public CaseFilter CaseFilter { get; private set; }

    public CaseIndexViewModel(PaginatedList&lt;Case&gt; paginatedCases, CaseFilter caseFilter)
    {

       PaginatedCases = paginatedCases;
       CaseFilter = caseFilter;
    }

"53718","<p>I have a situation where my XSLT files should display prices alongwith decimals conditionally, depending on whether the input XML contains decimals or not. So, I can receive XML files with two types of values - XML will contain all prices formatted with decimals upto two places (I call this one ""Decimal-XML"") or the prices will be rounded off to the nearest integer (I call this one ""Integer-XML"").</p>

<p>My problem is that I need to refactor as little as possible in the XSLT files and yet allow them to apply the transformation to XHTML in the same format as the XML input. In order to accomplish this, I implemented and suggested three guidelines to my team:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove all <code>format-number()</code> function calls when the value is being computed for calculations or stored in a variable. Use <code>number(&lt;value&gt;)</code> instead. However, certain conditions apply to this rule (See below).</li>
<li>When the value is to be displayed, use the <code>format-number(&lt;value&gt;, '#.##')</code> format. This should ensure that integer or decimal values will be displayed as originally present in the XML. </li>
<li>For optional tags (such as ""Discount""), use the <code>format-number(&lt;value&gt;, '0.00')</code> function even if the value is only being computed. This is necessary because if the tag is absent, trying to obtain a value will give an <code>NaN</code> result.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is a illustrative example of the XSLT:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;x:stylesheet version=""1.0"" xmlns:x=""http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform""&gt;
  &lt;x:template match=""/""&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;table border=""1"" width=""60%""&gt;
          &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Simple&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;number()&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;format-number(&amp;lt;expression&amp;gt;, '0.00')&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;format-number(&amp;lt;expression&amp;gt;, '#.##')&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;
          &lt;x:apply-templates /&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
  &lt;/x:template&gt;

  &lt;x:template match=""Item""&gt;
    &lt;x:variable name=""qty"" select=""number(@numItems)"" /&gt;
    &lt;x:variable name=""cost"" select=""number(ItemCost) * $qty"" /&gt;
    &lt;x:variable name=""extraCharges"" select=""(number(Tax) + number(TxnFee)) * $qty""/&gt;
    &lt;x:variable name=""discount"" select=""format-number(Discount, '0.00') * $qty""/&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;!-- Works for Integer-XML, but values in Decimal-XML are
      *sometimes* rendered upto 14 decimal places. Even though Quickwatch
      shows it correctly in the debugger in VS. I cannot figure out what's
      special about the error cases. --&gt;
        &lt;x:value-of select=""$cost + $extraCharges - $discount""/&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;!-- Works same as the above case. --&gt;
        &lt;x:value-of select=""number($cost + $extraCharges - $discount)""/&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;!-- Works for Decimal-XML, but values in Integer-XML are always
      rendered with decimal digits. --&gt;
        &lt;x:value-of select=""format-number(($cost + $extraCharges - $discount), '0.00')""/&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;!-- Works for Integer-XML, but some values in Decimal-XML are
      rendered incorrectly. For example, 95.20 is rendered as 95.2;
      95.00 is rendered as 95 --&gt;
        &lt;x:value-of select=""format-number(($cost + $extraCharges - $discount), '#.##')""/&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/x:template&gt;
&lt;/x:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As the HTML comments note, it works in most cases but not all.</p>

<p>I would like to use a single expression to format all prices same as the input, rather than applying ""when-otherwise"" constructs everywhere which would additionally require a boolean parameter passed to the XSLT to determine the display format. The present state of the XSLT is that all numbers are rounded off regardless of the input, using <code>format-number(&lt;expression&gt;, '0')</code>.</p>

<p>How do I accomplish this?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> After Dimitre's comment, I decided to create a sample XML (and the XSLT above) so the experts can try it out easily.</p>

<p>Sample XML (This one contains decimals):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ShoppingList&gt;
  &lt;Item numItems=""2""&gt;
    &lt;ItemCost&gt;10.99&lt;/ItemCost&gt;
    &lt;Tax&gt;3.99&lt;/Tax&gt;
    &lt;TxnFee&gt;2.99&lt;/TxnFee&gt;
    &lt;Discount&gt;2.99&lt;/Discount&gt;
  &lt;/Item&gt;
  &lt;Item numItems=""4""&gt;
    &lt;ItemCost&gt;15.50&lt;/ItemCost&gt;
    &lt;Tax&gt;5.50&lt;/Tax&gt;
    &lt;TxnFee&gt;3.50&lt;/TxnFee&gt;
    &lt;Discount&gt;3.50&lt;/Discount&gt;

"81008","<p>Sorry if this is obvious or covered elsewhere, but i've been googling all day and haven't found a solution that actually worked.</p>

<p>My problem is as follows: I am currently drawing an image in a full screen UIView, for examples sake we'll say the image is in the bottom right corner of the UIView. I'd like to do a rotation transform(CGAffineTransformMakeRotation) at the center of that image, however, by default the rotation command rotates around the center of the UIView it self. As a result, my image moves around the screen when i rotate instead of it staying in place and rotating around its own center.</p>

<p>From what i've gathered, i need to translate my context so that the origin(center of the UIView) is at the center of my image, Rotate, and then restore the context by translating back to the original spot.</p>

<p>The following is the closest thing i've gotten to work, but the problem is that while the image is rotating, it moves downward while it's rotating. I think this is caused by animation tweening the 1st step translate and 3rd step translate instead of just realizing that the beginning and end point on the translates would be the same...</p>

<pre><code>// Before this i'd make a call to a function that draws a path to a passed in context
CGAffineTransform inverseTranslation = CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation( transX, transY );
CGAffineTransform translation = CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation( -transX, -transY );
CGAffineTransform rot = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation( 3.14 );
CGAffineTransform final = CGAffineTransformConcat( CGAffineTransformConcat( inverseTranslation, rot ), translation );
// Then i apply the transformation animation like normal using self.transform = final etc etc
</code></pre>

<p>I've also tried stuff like CGContextTranslateCTM and    CGContextSaveGState/UIGraphicsPushContext, but these seem to have little effect.</p>

<p>I've been fighting with this for days and my current solution seems close, but i have no clue how to get rid of that translating tweening. Does anyone have a solution for this or a better way to go about this?</p>

<p>[update]
For the time being i'm drawing my image centered at the UIview's center and then setting the UIView.center property to the origin i'd like to rotate and then doing the rotate command. Seems like a bit of a hack, but until i can get the real translates working it's my only choice.
Thanks!</p>

"33371","<p>Greetings all,</p>

<p>Is there a built in way to know when a user is done typing into a textbox? (Before hitting tab, Or moving the mouse)  I have a database query that occurs on the textchanged event and everything works perfectly.  However, I noticed that there is a bit of lag of course because if a user is quickly typing into the textbox the program is busy doing a query for each character.  So what I was hoping for was a way to see if the user has finished typing.  So if they type ""a"" and stop then an event fires.  However, if they type ""all the way"" the event fires after the y keyup.</p>

<p>I have some ideas floating around my head but I'm sure they aren't the most efficient.  Like measuring the time since the last textchange event and if it was > than a certain value then it would proceed to run the rest of my procedures.</p>

"76734","<p>I'm looking for an easy (no database) method of listing how many users are active on a website.  The easiest way I can come up with is by counting the number of open sessions.</p>

<p>This code <em>should work:</em></p>

<p>Of course it won't because of the security constraints on that directory (as there should be!!).  Does anyone know another way to access this number without changing directory permissions.</p>

<pre><code>ls /var/lib/php5/ | wc -l &gt; /var/www/sessioncount

<p>Make sure the <code>/var/www/sessioncount</code> file is readable by the apache user.  Then you can just read the file in PHP:</p>

"26447","<p>Here's a simple problem I need to solve, but it makes me feel my hair turning gray as all my attempts are returning me the same error:</p>

<p>""Attempted to read or write protected memory. This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt.""</p>

<p>I have a sample app written in C++ which makes a call to the dll. Here is the relevant code:</p>

<pre><code>    //function I need to call
bool convertHKID_Name(char *code,RECO_DATA *o_data);	//hkid

//struct definition
struct RECO_DATA{

char _code[200];
WideCharToMultiByte(CP_UTF8, 0, code, -1, (char *)_code, 200, NULL, NULL);
ocr-&gt;convertHKID_Name(_code,&amp;data)
</code></pre>

<p>Now when I debug the C++ code, it does the proper thing - writes some Unicode data into the data struct.</p>

<p>Here is my attempt to do the same in C#</p>

<pre><code>    //my C# wrapper class

        public string Surname;
    };

    [DllImport(@""cnOCRsdk.dll"", CharSet=CharSet.Auto, EntryPoint = ""?convertHKID_Name@CcnOCRsdk@@QAE_NPADPAURECO_DATA@@@Z"")]

        [Out, MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPStr)]StringBuilder lpMultiByteStr,
        int cbMultiByte,
        IntPtr lpDefaultChar, // Defined as IntPtr because in most cases is better to pass
        IntPtr lpUsedDefaultChar // NULL
        );
}

//my attempt to call the function from the dll
cnOCRsdk.RECO_DATA recoData = new cnOCRsdk.RECO_DATA();
string num = ""262125355174"";
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(200, 200);
cnOCRsdk.WideCharToMultiByte(65001, 0, num, -1, sb, 200, IntPtr.Zero, IntPtr.Zero);
string sbTostring = sb.ToString();
//the next line generates the 'Attempted to read or write protected memory' error
bool res = cnOCRsdk.convertHKID_Name(ref sbTostring, out recoData);

<p>My guess is that I'm not marshaling the RECO_DATA structure properly, because it is this struct that gets written to by the convertHKID_Name function. But how should I fix it?</p>

"2183","<p>On Linux, the command ps aux outputs a list of processes with multiple columns for each stat. e.g.</p>

<p>I want to be able to read this in using Python and split out each row and then each column so they can be used as values.</p>

<p>For the most part, this is not a problem:</p>

<pre><code>ps = subprocess.Popen(['ps', 'aux'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE).communicate()[0]
processes = ps.split('\n')

for row in processes:
    print sep.split(row)

<p>However, the problem is that the last column, the command, sometimes has spaces in. In the example above this can be seen in command </p>

<pre><code>['postfix', '22611', '0.0', '0.2', '54136', '2544', '?', 'S', '15:26', '0:00', 'pickup', '-l', '-t', 'fifo', '-u']

<p>Now the encrypted string that I get is of 128 bytes (256 hex characters). This string is too big for me. I was kind of hoping that I would get 16 bytes of encrypted data if I give 16 bytes of plain data. Am I doing something wrong? Is this what is supposed to happen? Can I somehow shorten encrypted data?</p>

"4035","<p><strong>SQL Server Edition</strong>: SQL Server 2005 w/ SP3 and 2008</p>

<p>Is there a built-in SQL Server stored procedures that will retrieve following information?
Or a DMV (Dynamic Management View) would be great as well.</p>

<p>I am interested mainly on how to find out <strong>FILEGROUP</strong> data of a table specifically.
But it'd be better if there was a sproc that will return all of following result.</p>

<p>By the way, is there any documents that shows one-to-one matching of how to retrieve data that SQL Server UI displays?</p>

"78026","<p>I want to use jQuery to detect clicks on a bunch of radio buttons. They have all been assigned a css class, foobar, to detect them. Easy, right? Still, this code doesn't work:</p>

<pre><code>$(""input.foobar"").click(function ()
{
    alert(this.id);
}
);
</code></pre>

<p>What wrong with the code above?</p>

<p>Does <code>this.id</code> really return the id of the current radio button?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The HTML on the page is really borked (doesn't valdiate), so maybe that's the problem...</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> The HTML is messed up beyond salvation. Will have to let it be and fix a workaround. May the HTML Gods forgive me!</p>

"54327","<p>I have a large collection of php files written over the years and I need to properly replace all the short open tags into proper explicit open tags.</p>

<pre><code>change ""&lt;?"" into ""&lt;?php""
</code></pre>

<p>I think this regular expression will properly select them :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;\?(\s|\n|\t|[^a-zA-Z])
</code></pre>

<p>which takes care of cases like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?//
&lt;?/*
</code></pre>

<p>but I am not sure how to process a whole folder tree + detect the .php file extension + apply the regular expression + save the file it it has been changed.</p>

<p>I have the feeling this can be pretty straightforward if you master the right tools. (There is an interesting hack in the sed manual : 4.3 Example/Lowercase to Uppercase)<br />
Maybe I'm wrong.<br />
Or maybe this could be a one liner?</p>

<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

"57133","<p>Im working on this large DB which has a lot of the business knowledge embedded in the SPs[I know!] and there is a lot of chaining between the SPs. i.e one stored proc calling another. </p>

<p>Im want to find out a list of stored procedures which  update a particular column. How would I do that.</p>

<p>Using showplan_All as outlined in
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/283214/sql-table-and-column-parser-for-stored-procedures"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/283214/sql-table-and-column-parser-for-stored-procedures</a> doesnt work for me, because this is a shared dev db.</p>

<p>using a Sp from master db scanning system text as described is not feasible because I dont have access to the master db.</p>

<p>So how can I find this informaion?</p>

"83088","<p>While studying C++ (and C) I had some particular doubts regarding the working of stack allocation, that I can't find a solution to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Does stack allocation call malloc/free functions implicitly? If not; how does it assure there is no conflict between stack allocation and heap allocation?</p></li>
<li><p>If yes; does stack allocation in C++ implicitly call new/delete too? If yes; does overloading the new operator for a class affect its stack allocation?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It yielded confusing results in VC++; but as VC++ isn't entirely standard-compliant (or so I heard) I decided I better ask here...</p>
